<p>We must tell our little readers something about
this number of their Library. It was sent to us by
a very kind old uncle of ours, who, when we were
young, was so much from home, visiting various
places in the world, that we do not remember seeing
him very often at that period. At last, the old man,
finding that he could not bear fatigue as he had
done when young, determined to come home; and
we had heard so much about him that we were quite
anxious to see him. He came to our house one
evening, and appeared rather odd to us; but he was
so good-natured, and told us so many curious things,
that we soon forgot his odd appearance.</p>

<p>The old gentleman brought home with him a very
large number of books, and a great many strange
things which he had gathered in his travels, such as
stones, and dried insects, and leaves, and flowers,
and stuffed birds, and animals. He did not stay
with us long, but went to the village where he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
born, and built a small house to which he carried all
his books and curiosities, and said that he should
spend the rest of his days there.</p>

<p>We sometimes pay him a visit. The last time
we were there, we found him talking to several children
around him. In the beginning of the book
there is a picture of the old gentleman. After you
have looked at it, you may read the letter which he
sent us, and learn how he came to write this book.</p>

</p>

<p>I was very much pleased to receive the numbers
of your Library for Boys and Girls which you sent
to me. You know I am now an old man, and have
travelled a great deal, and seen a great many strange
things in the course of my life. I am too old to travel
any more, and so I am quietly living in the cottage I
built by the side of that pleasant and shady little
stream where I played when I was a boy. I read
my books, and especially that best of all of them,
my Bible; and so am patiently waiting till my
Heavenly Father shall call me to take my last journey;
when I hope, for the sake of the blessed
Saviour, to go to Him. Sometimes I walk out
into the village, and meet the children and have a
long talk with them. They all know me; and very
often, some of them will come to my house, and
ask me to tell them about things which I have seen
in my travels or read of in books: and so I spend
many happy hours with the little creatures; for you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
know how much I love children. When I had
read the books you sent to me, I lent them to
the children, who were delighted; and I thought
that if I should sometimes write down what we here
talked about, it might please the little boys and girls
for whom you print your books, and perhaps they
might learn something from our conversations which
would be useful: and so I determined to send them
to you, from time to time, to print, if you pleased.</p>

<p>If you think fit to print what I send, just tell your
little readers who I am; an aged and quiet old man,
who is very fond of little boys and girls, and wishes
them to be wise and good here, and happy hereafter,
and that I am your</p>

<p class="margin-top1">P.S. If you print what I send now, please to print

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_PARENTS" id="PREFACE_TO_PARENTS"></a>PREFACE TO PARENTS.</h2>

<p>The author of the following book avails himself
of the opportunity afforded by its publication,
to address a word to those who sustain the delightful
and responsible relation of parents.</p>

<p>To such of that class as may honour by a perusal
this humble attempt to interest and instruct their
offspring, the author need not say that the subject
of his book possesses for himself peculiar attractions:
it will readily be perceived that he has found
a charm in the pursuits of the naturalist. The
votary of a favourite science would anticipate too
much, should he expect every one to partake of the
enthusiasm which is apt to stimulate him; it is
wisely and kindly ordered that we shall not all be
enthusiasts in the same direction. The author, however,
still ventures to hope, that in his subject there
is enough to attract, though it may fail to fascinate.
He hopes, too, that it will be found not attractive
merely, but profitable also to his young countrymen.
There are many reasons on which to found such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
a hope. If to entertain reverence for our Maker,
to admire and adore his wisdom and goodness in
the illustrations of nature, thankfully to acknowledge
and duly to improve the superiority which
mind confers, be exercises in which a wise parent
would desire to train a child,&mdash;the study of natural
science is admirably adapted to the attainment
of these objects. Again, if it be desirable to encourage
habits of patient observation, accuracy of
investigation, and soundness of thought; let the volume
of nature be opened before the youthful mind.
If to learn <i>things</i> be better than to learn <i>words</i>, it
is important to place things before the growing
intellects of the young. Let it not be supposed that
to present matters of science intelligibly to the minds
of children is a hopeless task. It requires not
learning or maturity of understanding to perceive
a <i>fact</i>; it needs only the ordinary senses which God
has bestowed alike upon children and their parents.
Natural science is emphatically the science of
<i>facts</i>; built upon any other foundation it becomes
conjecture merely: and he knows but little of the
mind of a child who is not aware of the facility with
which a fact is impressed upon it. The secret of
instructing the young will be found to consist more
in the mode of communication than in the nature
of the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the style of this work a word may be said;
not, of course, for the purpose of disarming criticism
(for truly the writer has never supposed his trifle worth
the critic's labour or notice), but simply to remark,
that the object has been to write for the minds of <i>children</i>;
if the book be intelligible to them, the utmost
ambition of Uncle Philip will be attained. Truth
and plainness were all he sought. The first he believes
he has attained; and to determine his success
in attempting the last, he turns from the parents, and
looks for the decision of the question to the suffrages
of the children. He would rather hear the expression
of satisfaction from the lips of one intelligent
little reader, than receive the words of approbation
from many who are elders; the first is testimony
derived from experience, the last is but opinion.
Children always know better than any one else does
what books they understand.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the author owes it to himself to
say to the parents of his young countrymen, and to
the patrons of the "Boy's and Girl's Library,"
that what he has written will be found on the side
of religion and morals. So far as these important
points are concerned, the writer is not ashamed
to avow himself a Christian; nor yet does he mean
to make it the subject of boasting. In his simple
view, Christianity is a very quiet and gentle thing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
which eschews strife, and promotes practical goodness;
and truly can he say, that he has indulged
in some of his happiest and, as he trusts, his holiest
musings when, in the solitary pursuit of his
favourite science,&mdash;to use the language of good old
Izaak Walton, that simple-hearted lover of God, and
all his works,&mdash;"he has looked upon the wonders
of nature with admiration, or found some harmless
insect to content him, and pass away a little time,
without offence to God, or injury to man."</p>

that can work with a Saw and a Rasp, like the Carpenter.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, boys, this is a beautiful day. The
sun is shining brightly, and the birds are
singing, and the insects are flying about, and
the grass is green, and every thing appears
pleasant, and you feel happy too, and have
come, I suppose, to see old Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Philip, we are tired of playing
now, and so we have come to ask you to talk
with us, and tell us about some of the
curious things you know."</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I will tell you about some
very strange things. I will talk to you about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
animals that know how to work with tools
like a man."</p>

<p>"Work with tools, Uncle Philip! That
is strange; but we know it is so, if you say
so; because you will not tell us any stories
but true ones. But where do they get the
tools?"</p>

<p>"Ah, boys, 'the hand that made them is
<i>divine</i>!' They get them where we get all
that is useful and good,&mdash;from God. The
Bible says that He '<i>is wise in heart, and wonderful
in working</i>;' and he has made many
a poor little insect, and given it tools to work
with for its comfort, as good and perfect as
any that man can make. Yes, these poor
little creatures had tools long before man had.
God cares for the insects, boys, as well as
for us."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, what sort of tools do
you mean? Tell us about them."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will; do you think of some
kind of tools that men use: think of the carpenter
and his tools, and let us see if we cannot
find some of them among the insects."</p>

<p>"Why, the carpenter has a saw. Is there
any saw among these little fellows?"</p>

<p>"Yes indeed, there is; and a capital saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
it is. Now listen, and I will tell you all about
it. There is a kind of fly called the <i>saw-fly</i>;
it has four wings, and commonly its body is
yellow, and its head is black; but the most
curious part of it is the saw. The young
ones feed upon the leaves of rose-bushes, and
gooseberries, and raspberries, and currants,
and several other kinds of bushes; and the
old ones always lay their eggs on the branches
of these bushes, so that the young ones may
have something to eat as soon as they come
out. It uses its saw to make a place in the
branch to put its egg in."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, what is the saw made of?"</p>

<p>"It is made of something like horn, and
is fixed very nicely in a case; it resembles
what the cabinet-makers call a <i>tenon-saw</i> more
than it does the carpenter's common saw.
The tenon-saw is made of a thin plate of
steel, and has a stiff brass back, to keep it from
bending. The brass back has a groove in it,
and the saw is put in that groove, and then
it is fastened to it. But the fly's saw is fixed
in another way: there is a back to it too, but
that back is not fastened to the saw. The
groove is in the saw, and there is a ridge all
along the back-piece, which just fits in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
groove, and so the saw slides backwards and
forwards, and the ridge always keeps it in its
place. Besides all this, boys, the fly is better
off than the cabinet-maker, for he uses only
one saw at a time; but our little workman
has two exactly alike, and they are so fixed
that the creature first pushes out one, and
when it is drawing that back, pushes out
the other; so that it is all the time cutting,
and does double work. I think the fly's saw
is the best, too, for another reason. The
saws of the carpenter and cabinet-maker
have their teeth bent; first, one a little on
one side, and then the next to it a little on the
other side, and so on to the end of the saw;
so that when sawing, the cut may be wide
enough for the blade to move easily. Now
the fly's saw has the teeth a little bent, or
twisted, too; but it has something else: on
the outside of every tooth there are a great
many very small teeth, so that the outside of
every one is just like a <i>rasp</i>, or <i>file</i>."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, it must take them a
great while to saw a very little cut; they are
so small."</p>

<p>"Yes, it does; but they persevere. It takes
them more than an hour and a half to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
one groove, and sometimes they will go on
and make as many as six without stopping.
That shows, boys, what perseverance will do."</p>

<p>"And when it is done sawing, Uncle Philip,
where does it keep its saws?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I told you they fitted in a case; but
when the fly is done sawing, it uses the saws
to put the egg in the place cut for it, and then
it draws the saws almost entirely into the
case, and drops upon the egg a sort of frothy
stuff like a drop of soap-lather."</p>

<p>"What is that for?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is to glue the egg fast, or else
to keep the juices in the bush from hurting
it."</p>

<p>"Well, this is a curious fly, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"It is strange, boys, because you never
heard of it before; but it is a cunning fly, as
well as a curious one."</p>

<p>"What does it do, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Why, when it is frightened, it will fold
up its case and saws under its body, and draw
up its legs, and pretend to be dead; and then
it will not move, even if you stick a pin
through it."</p>

<p>"Can you tell us any thing more about
this fly?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing very strange, boys; but we have
found out <i>two</i> tools, I think, a saw and a rasp,
and that is enough for one poor little fly to
give us. Here, boys, are pictures of these
saws; I have made them a great deal larger
than they are in the fly, so that you can see
them plainly."</p>

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Philip tells the Children about Grasshoppers
and Bees, that bore Holes with a Gimlet.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Uncle Philip, here we are again, to
hear more about the tools that animals work
with; we have seen in the bark of trees, and
old wooden posts, little holes as round as a
gimlet could make, and we have been thinking
whether any of these little creatures have
augers and gimlets, as well as saws. Do
you know of any of them that can bore
holes?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, boys; I know of more than one
that can bore as smooth and round a hole as
any carpenter you ever saw. There are some
of the grasshoppers that have an excellent
gimlet. The contrivance has five pieces in
it; two of the pieces make a case to keep the
augers in, two more are the augers or borers,
and the other is a piece between the two borers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
on which they slide; this piece has a ridge on
each side of it, and the augers have a groove
which exactly fits the ridge. Besides this,
each auger ends in a knob, and that knob has
teeth all around it. Here is a picture of it."</p>

  <div class="caption">Ovipositors, with files, of the Grasshopper, magnified.</div>
</div>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, what is the piece with
the ridge for?"</p>

<p>"Ah, boys, that piece shows the wisdom
and the goodness of God. '<i>His tender mercies
are over all his works</i>:' he has placed
that piece there to keep the borers stiff, so that
they cannot get out of joint, or be broken,
when the little workman is boring."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, this is very curious."</p>

<p>"Yes; but there are some of these insect
workmen more curious still. Did you ever
see a spy-glass? You know it is a round,
hollow piece of wood, with brass tubes in it,
which are made smaller and smaller, so as to
slide into one another, when the glass is not
used. Now there is a sort of gadfly (she is a
little creature, too) which has exactly such a
contrivance to keep her gimlet in. It is in
four pieces, and the smallest piece ends in
five sharp points, three of which are longer
than the other two: she twists these five sharp
points into one piece, and as some are longer
and some shorter, when they are all put together,
they make a sharp edge running all
around, and are almost exactly like an auger
or gimlet. When she wants to use it,
she just shoots out the different tubes, so as
to make a stem for the gimlet; and when she
is done, she puts all back into its case again.</p>

<p>"Here is a drawing of it, and I think that
by looking at it you will understand what
I have been telling you: I do not know
whether men learned from this part of the fly
how to make the case of a spy-glass; but I
know they might have learned.</p>

</div>

<p>"There is also a bee, boys, which is called
the <i>carpenter-bee</i>, because it is such an excellent
wood-borer. It commonly looks for some
old post, or dry plank, or withered part of a
tree, to work in. It never works in wood that
is green and has the sap or juices in it; for
the bee knows, just as well as any carpenter
does, that it is very hard to get tools through
such wood. I expect that you have seen
sometimes, when an old post or dry board was
split, a long hollow groove in the middle of it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
with little round thin pieces of something like
paper, about as thick as a wafer, fastened in
it by their edges, one above the other, all the
way through. These show the work of the
carpenter-bee: she bored the hole, and she put
those little partitions like paper in it, to separate
the cells; and more than that, she made
the partitions out of the dust she got by boring.
She always likes, too, to get a piece of
wood in a place where the sun can shine on
it; and when she has made her choice, she
begins to bore at first into the post in a slanting
direction, and as soon as she has gone
far enough in, she then turns and bores
straight, with the grain of the wood."</p>

<p>"Does she do it quickly, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Not very quickly, for sometimes the wood
is very hard; I have seen one of these holes
nearly twelve inches long in a very hard oak
board. Sometimes she has to work at it for
months; but she works steadily, boys, and
that does a great deal. What makes it more
tiresome is, that the poor little creature has to
bring out all the dust she makes by boring."</p>

<p>"How large is the hole?"</p>

<p>"Oh, large enough to put my forefinger in,
and sometimes fifteen inches long. After she
has bored it as deep as is necessary, she begins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
to divide it into separate cells. So she commences
at the bottom, and puts in a quantity of
what is called bee-bread, until it reaches about
an inch in height; on the top of this she lays
an egg, and the bread is put there to feed the
young one as soon as it comes out of the egg.
She then makes a floor over it out of the dust,
as I told you; she knows how to glue this
dust together, and she brings it grain by grain
from the heap in which she put it when she
first brought it out: and she always begins
by gluing the dust around the outside of the
hole she has bored, and then glues another
ring to that, and then another, and another,
making each ring smaller and smaller, until
she has it all filled; so that her floor, when it
is done, appears like a parcel of rings of
smaller and smaller sizes placed within each
other. On the top of this floor she puts bee-bread,
as before, and places another egg on it,
and then covers it with a floor again; and so
she goes on making cells and filling them with
bread, and covering each with a floor, until
she has filled up the hole."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, how do the young bees get
out when the egg is hatched? It seems as if
they were shut up for ever in prison."</p>

<p>"No, boys; there is a way for them to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
out, and it shows the wonderful wisdom of
God in teaching this poor bee how to contrive
the matter. The egg which is put in the
lowest cell being the oldest, the little worm
that is afterward to be a bee will come out
of that one first: now, you know, he never
could get through all the cells over his head,
filled as they are with bee-bread, so as to come
out at the top of the hole. If he gets out at
all, then, it must be at the bottom. The old
bee knows this, and she so arranges these
eggs that when the worm comes out it will be
with his head pointed downwards; he falls to
eating his bread, and so eats himself down to
the bottom of his cell, and there he finds that
his mother has bored a hole from his cell to
the outside, and through that he comes out.
When his brother in the cell above him has
eaten his way down to the bottom of his cell,
he just eats through the floor and gets into
the cell below, which is then empty, you
know, and walks out at the same hole which
his older brother used before him. And so all
the rest one after another eat their way downwards
into the empty cells below them, and
get out at the same back-door, which their
mother made by what we call her <i>instinct</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
which just means the share of wisdom which
God gives to the lower animals to show them
how to take care of themselves."</p>

many stories of animals, which will show you
their instinct. But for this time I have told

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Philip tells the Children about Animals
  that are Tailors.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Uncle Philip</span>, we are very glad to see
you, and we think we have found out something
to ask you, about a kind of work which
men do, that no other animal can accomplish.
As we came along this morning to visit you,
and were talking of what you had told us of
insects that, like carpenters, could saw wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and bore holes in it, we passed by the tailor's
shop, near the church; 'and now,' said we,
'we have found out something which will
puzzle good Uncle Philip: there are surely no
tailors among the lower animals; so we will
ask him to-day to talk about creatures that
can cut out cloth and sew it up with a
needle.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear children, there are a great
many things which would puzzle Uncle Philip.
I do not know every thing; nor do I suppose
that I can find <i>every</i> trade in the world among
the dumb creatures which God has made.
But you have made a bad choice of a puzzle
this morning, my boys; for there are tailors
among the inferior creatures, and some pretty
nice ones, too; at any rate, they always cut
so as to fit exactly."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip! You do not mean
to say that they can cut out <i>cloth</i>, and then
sew it up again with a needle and thread!"</p>

<p>"No, boys; I do not think it is to be expected
that they should take a pair of shears
and cut a piece of cloth, or put a piece of
thread through the eye of a steel needle; any
more than we expect the insect that saws, to
go to the cabinet-maker, and borrow his tool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to work with. But with the instruments
which God has given to them, they will cut
what is cloth to them, the leaves of trees and
flowers, and will sew them together too: and,
now I think of it, there is one that will cut
his garments out of our cloth."</p>

<p>"Pray let us hear about them, Uncle
Philip."</p>

<p>"Softly, boys, softly. I have two things to
say to you before I begin. In the first place, I
am very glad to hear that you think and talk
among yourselves about the things which I
tell you: and in the next place, I know that
you love <i>me</i>, and, therefore would not wish,
by <i>puzzling</i> me, as you call it, to produce
mortification or vexation; nor do I think that
I should have felt either vexed or mortified
had I not been able to find tailors among the
lower animals; but I do not wish you to take
pleasure in puzzling people; for it is very apt
to produce in you a feeling of triumph, and to
make you vain: and you must remember
that for <i>one</i> of your questions which cannot
be answered, a <i>thousand</i> might be put to you,
of the answer to which you would be ignorant.
No man, my dear boys, knows every
thing. Wise men talk with each other, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
they may learn from each other; and the
wisest are not ashamed to acknowledge their
ignorance of some things; and I believe they
take very little pleasure in puzzling. It is
our duty to learn all that we can, and to be
always willing at a proper time to teach
others what we know."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear Uncle Philip, for your
advice. We did not mean to triumph over
<i>you</i>, if you had not been able to tell us of
tailors among the animals. But we see that
you are right. We might get a foolish habit,
which would do us harm."</p>

<p>"Exactly what I meant, boys; and now
let us begin. And first we will talk of the
cutting out, as the tailor always does that before
he sews. There is a kind of bee
<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which,
like some of the insects we have already
spoken of, is furnished with a borer. With
this she forms a round hole, like that made
with an auger or gimlet, in a hard-trodden
path, or sometimes in a piece of soft decayed
wood. It is in making her nest in this hole
that she plays the part of a tailor, for the nest
is made of leaves, sometimes taken from the
rose, at others from the birch, ash, or other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
trees. The little creature cuts them commonly,
and I believe always, into two shapes.
They are either half-oval, that is, half the
shape of the bowl of a spoon, or round, and
are of different sizes. Sometimes she makes
a mistake in the size, and when she finds it
out, she alters it. These leaves are prepared
to line the hole which she has bored, and she
begins with the largest pieces; taking them
into the hole, she winds around in it, until
she has spread very smoothly a tube of leaves
the whole length of it; she then closes up
one end of it by rounding it off and doubling
the pieces of leaf one over another. In this
case she sets about making her <i>cells</i>. She
takes three of her half-oval pieces which have
been cut to fit, and contrives to roll them, so
that the edge of one piece will just lap over
the edge of the next; these, when she has finished
rolling them, make the hollow of the
cell, which is not quite an inch high. She
next turns up the ends of these pieces, which
are cut to fit, so as to form the bottom: she
then sets to work with three other pieces
rolled in the same way inside of the cell just
finished, turning up their ends as before to
form the bottom; and within these she again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
works three others, so that her cell, when it is
done, is of nine thicknesses of leaves. And
you see why, though she cuts the pieces of the
same shape, they are not all of one size: they
are of three sizes, so as to make the cells
within each other smaller and smaller."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, you have not said any
thing about the round pieces which she cuts;
how does she use them?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you: after she has finished one
cell she lays an egg in it, and fills it all round
with food nearly liquid; now as the cell is
lying down on its side, all this liquid food
would run out if it were not corked up, and
the bee therefore uses her circular pieces to
stop up the cells."</p>

<p>"And does she really make these round
pieces to fit the cell?"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, exactly; and they are cut too as
regularly as if they had been first measured
and marked with a pair of compasses. And,
more than this, the little creature will fit one in
in less than a minute. But the most curious
thing is, that sometimes she will fly off to a
distance to get this round piece, and bring
back one which will exactly suit; so that it
really seems as if she carried the size in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
head. After finishing one cell she will make
another, until she has completed as many as
she wants; and then, as she always builds
them one upon another, they appear like a
parcel of thimbles stuck into each other and
put into a case: and here is a picture of it."</p>

  alt="Rose-leaf-cutter Bees" />
  <div class="caption">Rose-leaf-cutter Bees, and Nest lined with Rose-leaves</div>
</div>

<p>"This is very wonderful, Uncle Philip;
and it does seem like cutting out pieces to fit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very true: but this is not the only cutter-out
of leaves among the bees. There is another
kind, called the poppy-bee,
<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> because it
uses the scarlet leaves of the poppy-flower to
line its cell. It makes its hole in the ground,
as smooth and regular and polished as can be,
and then proceeds to line it all around with
pieces of the leaves, and cuts them to fit as
she goes on. If a piece is too large she will
trim it down to the proper size and shape, and
always carries away the scraps. Now if you
should take a pair of scissors and try to cut
the leaf of a poppy-flower, you would wrinkle
it, but this little workman will spread out what
she cuts as smooth as glass. When she has
lined this hole throughout, and carried the
lining out beyond the entrance, she fills it with
honey and <i>pollen</i>, or bee-bread, as it is called,
about half an inch high, lays an egg, then
folds down the leaves on it, and finally fills
the upper part with earth."</p>

<p>"Then she was not working for herself?"</p>

<p>"No; she was providing a house for her
young, and God has taught her thus to take
care of it.</p>

<p>"I will now tell you of another little workman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
which I have heard called the cloak-maker,
because it makes for itself a mantle
which really appears very much like a cloak;
and, stranger still, this cloak is lined throughout
with silk."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Listen, and you shall hear. These mantle-looking
cases are made by the <i>larva</i>, as it
is called, or grub of a little moth which forms
a covering of pure silk; this silk it spins
from itself; it is not woven so as to appear
like our silk, but still it is real silk, and
is worked into a great many thin scales,
which lap over one another like the scales
of a fish. But this is only the lining of
the cloak. This little tailor is the field-moth,
which first eats what it wants from a green
leaf, and then, from the thin membranes left,
sets about making its mantle: and it makes
it of two pieces cut out and joined together
with a seam, just as a tailor would make it."</p>

<p>"How does it go to work, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Why, I will give you the account as it
was given by a gentleman<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who was very fond
of observing insects, and who watched one of
these little creatures. He says that from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
thin membrane of the leaf it first cut two
pieces just equal in size and of exactly the
same shape; each of these pieces was to form
one-half of the cloak, and this he says was
done wonderfully fast. He noticed, too, that
one end of each piece, that which was meant
for the bottom of the cloak, was just twice as
long as the other end, which was the top.
The insect then placed itself between the two
pieces while they were lying flat; it afterward
brought the two sides where the seam was to
be, together, and fastened them at certain
places, still leaving, however, considerable
spaces open. It then began to turn and twist
its body about in all directions, until it
moulded the pieces into a hollow form to fit.
When it found that it would fit its body, it
brought the edges of the seam close together
through the whole length, and contrived to
sew or fasten them so neatly together, that
when the gentleman looked, even with a magnifying-glass,
he said he could hardly find the
seam. The whole was lined with the silk
spun from itself, and was finished in about
twelve hours."</p>

<p>"Why, this little workman is the strangest
of all: but, Uncle Philip, you said there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
one of these animal tailors that cut his garment
out of <i>cloth</i>: pray tell us of him."</p>

<p>"When I said that, boys, I was thinking of
the clothes-moth.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They make their coats
of wool commonly taken from our cloth, and
silk drawn from their own mouths; and the
strangest thing concerning them is, that when
they outgrow their clothes they will piece
them to make them larger. Suppose the insect
wants it longer, it adds a new ring of
wool to the end: suppose it wants it wider, it
slits the case or garment, not from one end to
the other, for this would leave it naked, but it
splits it half-way down the sides, and when it
has filled it in with proper pieces, it splits the
remaining half, and puts other pieces in them.
There is another curious thing about this
tailor: it always makes its coat of the same
colour with the cloth from which it takes the
wool; so that if it has first made its garment
of a piece of blue cloth, and is placed on a
bit of red cloth when it wishes to enlarge it,
you will see its work exactly, for the pieces
which it puts in will be red. This is the little
fellow, boys, which does so much mischief to
our clothes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Philip, one can almost forgive
his mischief for the sake of his ingenuity.
But you have said nothing yet about <i>needles</i>;
how do these little creatures sew?"</p>

<p>"Why, they have what serves as a needle
to them: but I can tell you of another animal
which sews with a needle a great deal plainer
to be seen than that of these little insects."</p>

<p>"Pray let us hear of him, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"I must go among the birds to find this
workman. There is a kind of starling, called
the orchard starling,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> about which, Mr. Wilson,
a gentleman who has written a great deal concerning
the birds of our country, gives a very
curious account. He says that this bird commonly
hangs its nest from the twigs of an apple-tree,
and makes it in a very singular manner.
The outside is made of a particular kind
of long tough grass, that will bend without
breaking, and this grass is knit or sewed
through and through in a thousand directions,
just as if done with a needle. The little
creature does it with its feet and bill. Mr.
Wilson says that he one day showed one of
these nests to an old lady, and she was so
much struck with the work that she asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
him, half in earnest, if he did not think that
these birds could be taught to <i>darn stockings</i>?
Mr. Wilson took the pains too to draw out one
of these grass threads, and found that it measured
thirteen inches, and in that distance the
bird who used it had passed it in and out
thirty-four times."</p>

<p>"Why, this was sewing, sure enough."</p>

<p>"Yes; and I saw, when I was in the West
Indies, another kind of starling <a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which will
cut leaves into a shape like the quarter of an
orange-rind, and sew the whole very neatly to
the under side of a banana-leaf, so as to
make one side of the nest. But, boys, there
is another most beautiful little bird, which is
called the tailor-bird, because it sews so well.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
It first picks out a plant with large leaves, then
it gathers cotton from the shrub, and with the
help of its fine long bill and slender little feet
it spins this cotton into a thread, and then
using its bill for a needle, it will sew these
large leaves together to hide its nest, and sew
them very neatly, too."</p>

<p>"Why, dear Uncle Philip, this is the most
wonderful tailor of them all."</p>

<p>"He is, indeed: but, my children, what do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
we learn from all that I have been telling you?
Who made these little creatures with such
curious skill, and taught them to work so
well? It was the same God who made us;
for such wonderful things never came from
what people call <i>chance</i>. Chance, boys, never
made any thing: and how very wise he must
be to form such nice little workmen; and how
very good thus to teach them how to take care
of themselves. The Bible says, truly, that
'<i>his tender mercies are over all his works</i>.'
And I think, boys, we may learn another
thing: it is, not to be so very proud of what
we know; for I rather suppose that we shall
often find that the lower creatures around us
understood many of our trades long before we
found them out."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Philip, it is likely that these
little fellows you have been telling us of this
morning were the first tailors in the world."</p>

<p>"Very likely, very likely indeed, boys.
But now I must bid you good morning; for
here comes our good clergyman, and I am
going with him to see a poor sick woman."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Uncle Philip; we will
come again on Saturday."</p>

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Philip tells the Children about the first
Paper in the World, made by Wasps.</i></div>


<p>"Ah, boys! how do you do? This is Saturday,
and I have been expecting to see you
come for some time."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip, we should have been
here sooner, but we went round by the old
mill; because we thought that perhaps we
might find in some of the old timbers, holes
bored by some of those industrious little carpenters
you told us about."</p>

<p>"Well; and did you find any?"</p>

<p>"No; but we found something else, which
we have brought to show you: and we have
been talking about it all the way. We have
not discovered any new <i>tools</i> among the animals,
but we think we have found out a <i>trade</i>
that some of them work at; and we wish you
to tell us if we are right."</p>

<p>"Oh, that I will do, with pleasure, if I can.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
What is the trade that you think you have
discovered?"</p>

<p>"It is paper-making, Uncle Philip. We
have found this part of a wasp's nest, which
we have brought along; and as you told us
it was always best to notice every thing
closely, we examined this, and it appeared so
much like coarse paper that we thought (for
we knew it was made by wasps) that man did
not make the first paper in the world."</p>

<p>"Well, boys, that was not a bad thought.
Now you see the advantage of taking notice
of things, and of thinking about what you
see. You are perfectly right in supposing
that wasps make paper; and, if you please, we
will talk this morning about the wasps."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, yes, by all means, Uncle Philip;
and we will thank you, too."</p>

<p>"I must first tell you, then, that of the
wasps there are several kinds. Some build
their nests under ground, and some hang
theirs in the air to the limb of a tree. This
part of a nest which you have found belonged
to the last kind; but I will tell you
something about both. But before I begin let
me get some drawings I have, which will help
us to understand better. I have them. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
now, of the wasps which build under ground.
As soon as the warm season begins, the first
care of the mother-wasp is to look for a fit
place in which to build; and in the spring of
the year she may very often be seen flying
about a hole in the bank of a ditch, and looking
into it. These holes which she examines
are the old houses of field-mice or moles, and
some persons have thought, what I expect is
true, that she likes to take such old holes, because
they save her a great deal of hard work.
But still, as the holes are not large enough for
her use, she has a great deal of labour to
make them do. So she goes at once to work,
digging in the hole she has chosen, and
makes a winding, zigzag gallery, about two
feet long, and about an inch in width. She
digs out the earth, and carries it out, or
pushes it out behind her as she goes on.
This gallery ends in a large chamber or hole
from one to two feet across when it is done:
and now she is ready to begin her nest."</p>

<p>"Now then, Uncle Philip, she will begin to
make paper, will she not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but here I ought to tell you that it
was a long time before men found out what
she made it of. Do you remember my telling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
you of a gentleman who watched the
little cloak-maker to see how he made his
garment? Well, this gentleman, whose name
was Reaumur, was trying for twenty years,
he says, to find out how the wasp made
paper, before he succeeded. At last, one day,
he saw a female wasp alight on the sash of
his window and begin to gnaw the wood; he
watched her, and saw that she pulled off from
the wood fibre after fibre, about the tenth part
of an inch long, and not so large as a hair.
She gathered these up into a knot with her
feet, and then flew to another part of the sash,
and went to work, stripping off more fibres or
threads, and putting them to the bundle she
had already. At last he caught her, to examine
the bundle, and found that its colour
was exactly like that of a wasp's nest; but
the little ball was dry; she had not yet
wetted it to make a pulp of it which could
be spread out. He noticed another thing,
that this bundle was not at all like wood
gnawed by other insects; it was not sawdust,
but threads of some little length bruised into
lint. He then set to work himself with his
penknife, and very soon scraped and bruised
some of the wood of the same window-sash,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
so as to make a little ball exactly like the
wasp's. Mr. Reaumur thought that this was
the stuff out of which the wasp made paper, and
it has since been found out that he was right.
The animal wets its little bundle of bruised
wooden fibres or threads with a kind of glue
that it has, and this makes it stick together
like pulp or paste; and while it is soft, the
wasp walks backwards, and spreads it out
with her feet and her tongue, until she has
made it almost as thin as the thinnest paper.
With this she lines the top of the hole in
which she is going to build her nest, for she
always begins at the top. But this is so thin
that it would be too weak to keep the dirt
from falling in; and therefore she goes on
spreading her papers one upon the other
until she has made the wall nearly two inches
thick. These pieces are not laid exactly flat
on each other like two pieces of pasteboard,
but with little open spaces between, being
joined at the edges only. This is the ceiling;
and when it is finished she begins to build
what may be called the highest floor of the
nest; this she makes of the same paper in a
great number of little cells all joined together
at the sides; and instead of fastening this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
floor to the sides of the nest, she hangs it to
the ceiling by rods made also out of this
paper: these rods are small in the middle,
and grow larger towards the ends, so as to be
stronger. Here is a drawing of one.</p>

  alt="Rods from which the Floors are suspended" />
  <div class="caption">The Cut represents one of the Rods from which
     the Floors are suspended.</div>
</div>

<p>She then makes a second floor, and hangs
it under the first by rods as before; and the
whole of it, when finished, if it should be cut
straight through the middle, would appear
something like the following picture of one
which I made some years ago."</p>

</div>

<p>"This is a very ingenious little paper-maker.
Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, it is so. This of which I
have been telling you is the ground-wasp.
The tree-wasp makes its nest of paper prepared
in the same way; and the nests are
of different shapes. One makes it in a round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
flattened ball, not much larger than a rose,
and when cut open it shows layer upon layer
of leaves of the same thin grayish-looking
paper. This kind is not so common, however.
Here is one of their nests.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_052.jpg" id="i_052.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_052.jpg"
  alt="Wasp's Nest" />
  <div class="caption">Wasp's Nest.</div>
</div>

<p>"Another makes its nest of cells placed in
separate floors, but without any outer wall to
keep off the rain; and the most curious thing
in this nest is, that it is not placed in a horizontal
way; that is, it is not placed with the
floors level, because then the cells would catch
the rain, and the nest would be spoiled; but
it is always placed slanting, so that the rain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
may run off. It is always placed, too, so as
to face the north or the west, and I suppose it
is because the wasp knows that it is in more
danger of rain from the south and the east.
Here is a nest of this kind."</p>


<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_053.jpg" id="i_053.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_053.jpg"
  alt="Wasp's cells" />
  <div class="caption">Wasp's Cells attached to a branch.</div>
</div>

<p>"Ah, Uncle Philip! this must be a kind
of lazy wasp. It does not choose to take the
trouble to cover up the house, and so it hangs
it slanting, to make the rain run off."</p>

<p>"It may be so, boys; but I think that in
making this wasp lazy, you make it a very
sensible wasp; else how should it know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
water would run down a slanting surface?
But I cannot believe that it is so lazy; for,
though it does not cover up the whole house
in a paper shell, yet it does what no other
wasp does, it covers its nest with a complete
coat of shining, water-proof varnish, to prevent
the rain from soaking into the cells.
And putting on this varnish, I can tell
you, is no trifling work. It forms a pretty
large part of the labour of the whole swarm
belonging to the nest; and sometimes you
may see some of them at work for hours at a
time, spreading it on with their tongues. No,
my lads, he who wants an example of laziness,
will not find it among the wasps.</p>

<p>"But let us come back to the paper. Hornets
make paper for their nests much in the
same manner as the wasps do, only it is
coarser. There is, however, one kind of wasp
which makes a sort of paper more curious
than this which you have found. It is not a
wasp found in this country at all. It is the
Cayenne wasp, and so smooth, strong, and
white is the outside of his nest that it appears
like a card, and he is for that reason sometimes
called the card-maker wasp. He hangs
his nest on the branch of a tree, and it is so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
hard and polished on the outside that the rain
rolls off from it, as if it were glass. A little hole
in the lower end is left for the animal to pass
in and out; and in this picture of it, which I
have, a piece is left out of the side to show
how the cells within are fixed."</p>

  alt="Nest of the Card-maker Wasp" />
  <div class="caption">Nest of the Card-maker Wasp, with part removed to show the
    arrangement of the Cells.</div>
</div>

<p>"Well, then, Uncle Philip, we were right in
thinking that wasps were the first paper-makers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and very glad we are that we saw
this old piece of a wasp's nest. Who would
have thought that so much could be learned
by picking up this old scrap of a wasp's
work!"</p>

<p>"Very good sense, boys, in that thought.
A wise man will learn something from almost
any thing. Use your eyes, and think of what
you see. Now in this very trade of paper-making.
I think that man would have found
it out a great deal sooner if he had watched
the wasps at their work. They have been
excellent workmen at this business from the beginning;
and man has gone on learning little
by little of this very trade, as I will tell you at
some other time, when he might have made a
long step at once, had he but noticed wasps
and hornets. We go on very slowly sometimes
in learning to make a trade as perfect
as it can be: the poor animal, with its knowledge
such as God gave it, is often our superior.
These dumb creatures cannot teach us
every thing; there is a point to which they
can go, and no further: but as far as they do
know, their knowledge is perfect; and I make
no doubt that a great many useful things not
now known will hereafter be found out by
watching dumb animals."</p>

talk together.&mdash;Boys, do any of you know
Tom Smith?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
"Know him! Why, Uncle Philip, everybody
in this part of the country knows him;
he is such a shocking drunkard, and swears
so horribly, that nobody can forget him; and
what makes it worse, he is an old man, too.
His hair is almost as white as yours, Uncle
Philip."</p>

<p>"Yes; he is just about my age. We were
both born here, and I have known him ever
since we were boys; and when we played together
as children, over this very field which
we are now crossing, or caught fish in the
river down yonder by the rocks, there was not
a more decent, well-behaved, handsome boy
among us than was Tom Smith. Poor Tom
lost his father when he was about twelve years
old, and his mother, having no other child,
indulged him, until he was sent to the city to
go into a store. But Tom then, boys, had
good principles; he neither swore nor got
drunk. In a little time he fell into bad company,
and they led him astray by degrees.
He was so good-natured (as they call it), boys,
that he had never the firmness to say <i>no</i> to
the proposals of his companions. He went
with them to places of amusement; and instead
of spending his evenings in his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
room, reading, he was at the theatre, or dancing
in some place, or at a supper with his young
companions; and finally he began to play
cards and billiards with them; while the inside
of the church was a place which he never
saw. He was cheated by his companions;
and too honest he was then not to pay what
he lost by gaming: he wrote to his poor
mother, and told her the truth, as to his losses,
and she sent him money to pay his debts, and
told him to come home. He did come home;
and even after all that had happened, poor
Tom might have been respectable and happy;
for his friends were all willing to forget the
past, and encourage him for the future. For
a time he went on pretty well, and married
an affectionate and good young woman, and
his prospects were bright enough: but one
thing, boys&mdash;one single thing, ruined his comfort
for ever. In the city he had learned <i>to drink
strong liquors</i>.</p>

<p>"I remember, too, soon after he came
home and married, that a man was hung
not far from here for murdering his wife.
The man was a drunkard, though he was
quite sober when he killed the poor woman;
and drunkenness had hardened his heart.
I have no doubt, as it will the heart of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
any man. Tom was talking to me about that
man, and I remember he said then that when
a man <i>began</i> to drink, he could never say
where it would end, nor what he would do:
'therefore,' said Tom, 'beware of the <i>first</i>
drink.' But Tom, though he talked like a
Christian and a man about it, did not act like
one: for it was not long before he began to follow
his bad habit, and he soon killed his poor
mother; for she died of grief and sorrow, I think.
His excellent wife speedily followed her to the
grave; and Tom Smith left the village, a
perfect vagabond, whom no one cared for.
Where he went, or what he did for a long
time, no person here knows. I went to other
countries, and neither heard of nor saw Tom
Smith until my return home, when I found
him wandering about here, a gray-headed
swearer and drunkard. He did not know me,
and I never should have known him, had not
some one told me who he was. And last night
I received a letter from one of my nephews
in the city, which informed me that Tom
Smith had been tried in the court, and found
guilty of stealing, and was sent to the state
prison for ten years to hard work. There I
suppose he will die for he is now old; and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
is awful to think of what is then to become
of his soul. Ah, my dear boys! I could not
help thinking, when I read my letter, of what
that man said to me years ago&mdash;and I have
told you his story, hoping that you will remember
his words, 'Beware of the <i>first</i> drink.'
The man who does that will never be a
drunkard. And when old Uncle Philip is
laid in the grave, boys, which must be before
many years, remember, as you look upon the
place, that he told you the story of Tom
Smith, and charged you to 'beware of the <i>first</i>
drink.'</p>

<p>"But here come some of the boys, running
towards us; I suppose they have found something."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Philip! Uncle Philip! Do
come with the boys this way. Under that
fence yonder there are a great many beautiful
wild flowers, and a number of bees are as
busy as they can be about them; pray come
and see them."</p>

<p>"Well, I will; but not so fast, boys; you
forget that I am an old man, and cannot run
as you do.&mdash;So, here are, indeed, a great many
industrious little workmen."</p>

<p>"What are they doing, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"These are <i>workers</i> among the bees, and
they are gathering the dust out of the flowers,
to work it up into what is commonly called
bee-bread. More tools here, boys!"</p>

<p>"Tools, Uncle Philip! Ah, we like that:
pray let us hear of them; what are they?"</p>

<p>"Why, there is a brush and a basket in the
legs of these little fellows; but they are so
small that you cannot see them without a
microscope."</p>

<p>"What is a microscope?"</p>

<p>"It is an instrument, made by fixing glasses
in such a way to look through, that small
things will seem to be very large. Do you
not see how some of these little fellows are
rolling themselves over in the inside of the
flowers, so that the yellow dust is sticking to
them? Now their breasts, and legs, and
many other parts of their bodies are covered
with very short hairs, which catch the dust.
The last joint but one of each leg is made
exactly like a brush, the hairs being longer
there than on any other part; and with these
they brush off the dust, and get it into two
little heaps. The bags into which they put it,
or rather the baskets, are in the thighs of the
last pair of legs. These are hollow, so as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
form a three-sided basket. The bottom of it
is smooth and shining, and appears like horn,
and all around the edges are placed very
strong, thick-set hairs, like bristles."</p>

<p>"What are these for?"</p>

<p>"To keep things from falling out of the
basket; and these bristles are so strong that
even if they heap up more than the basket
will hold, the bristles will keep it from falling.
Here is a drawing of these legs.</p>

  <div class="caption">Structure of the legs of the Bee for carrying propolis
    and pollen, magnified.</div>
</div>

<p>Besides carrying this dust, they also carry
what is called <i>propolis</i>."</p>

<p>"What is propolis, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"It is a gum which is found upon some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
trees. This they work up into little balls,
and knead it until it is a little dry, so as not
to stick. This takes the bee sometimes as
much as half an hour. When the balls are
ready, she passes them backwards with her
feet to the basket, puts them in, and gives
them a pat or two to make them lie close;
and when she adds more, she pats it still
harder, and when the basket is full, away she
goes to the hive. But there is another curious
instrument about the bee. I mean its
sting: this is like the head of a barbed or
bearded arrow. There is a sheath for it when
the bee does not wish to use it; and here is a
picture of it.</p>

<p>But let us now continue our walk."</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Philip, it is really very pleasant
to walk with you: it seems as if you met
nothing which could not teach us things
worth knowing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, my dear boys, there are, as I told
you once before, a great many things which I
do not know; and what I do know I am very
willing to tell you. But you may learn just
as I did,&mdash;by reading, by taking notice of
things around you, and by thinking for yourselves.
And I do not know any thing more
pleasant to notice than the works of God. I
see his wisdom and his goodness in every
thing which he has made. I see them in the
insects, and the birds, and the larger animals;
I see them in the grass, and the flowers, and
the trees; and I see them in the rocks and
the stones upon the ground. All these things
are well worth our attention, boys; the study of
all these things around us is called the study
of 'Natural History;' and I think it is apt to
make him who loves it a better man; at any
rate, I believe that there have been very few
who have been fond of it, who have not been
amiable and benevolent men. But, hark! Do
you hear that noise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Philip; it is the sound of men
chopping wood in that clump of trees."</p>

<p>"No, boys; it is like the sound of a wood-cutter;
and it is a wood-cutter, but he does
not use one of our hatchets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it that he uses, then?"</p>

<p>"He uses the tool which God gave him.
It is a bird, boys, which you hear: it is the
woodpecker. See, there it is on yonder tree,
and look, at the foot of it, there is something
like a bushel of the bird's chips or dust.
Its bill is a complete chisel; it is straight,
hard, and sharp, with edges too upon the
sides. It is not a very broad chisel, but still it
is one, and used as we use ours. But the
chisel is not the only instrument of that
workman. Its tongue is worth examining.
It bores a hole into a tree that is dead or decaying,
to look for insects whose nests are in
the tree; and when it reaches the cell where
the young insect is, it uses its tongue to get
it out, and it suits exactly for the business.
In the first place, it is so long that the bird
can shoot it out three or four inches longer
than the bill is; in the next place the end of
it is tipped with a stiff, sharp, long thorn;
and in the last place, that thorn has little
teeth on both sides of it, like that which you
see on the point of a fish-hook: these teeth
are to keep the insect from falling off when
it puts its tongue in the hole and sticks its
sharp point into it to draw it out for food. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that besides the chisel, the woodpecker has a
spear, or lance, or arrow, barbed (as it is
called) or bearded at the point.</p>

<p>"But we are some distance, boys, beyond
the old mill: suppose we now turn back towards
home; I find the gnats rather troublesome."</p>

<p>"So do we, Uncle Philip; they have been
biting us for some time: it would be well if
there were no such tormenting things in the
world."</p>

<p>"I am not sure of that, boys. We may not
always be able to find out the exact use of
some of these little animals; but that only
shows that we are ignorant, not that they are
of no use. God would never have made them
if he had not some wise purpose in doing so:
I do not believe he ever wastes his power in
making useless things. But what will you
say about gnats, when I tell you that they have
a tool to work with, and a very perfect one,
too?"</p>

<p>"Why, we will almost forgive them for
biting us."</p>

<p>"Biting you! They have not been biting
with teeth: they are doctors, boys; they have
only been bleeding you, and cupping you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what have they been bleeding us
with?"</p>

<p>"Why, with a lancet, to be sure; what
should a doctor use but a lancet to let blood?"</p>

<p>"And has the gnat really a lancet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it has: this instrument forms a part
of what you may call the tongue of the gnat:
it is made up of five pieces, which are shut up
in a case, split from one end to the other;
these give steadiness to the lancet when it is
used. But the reason of the pain is not so
much the wound of the lancet, as it is the
fluid or poisonous juice which the gnat puts
into the wound to make the blood thin enough
for the insect to suck it up through a tube or
case, which makes part of its mouth. Here
is a drawing of part of a gnat's mouth.</p>

<p>"We have now reached the bridge,&mdash;and
here we must part; your homes are in one
direction, and mine is in the opposite. I hope,
however, that you have learned something in
our morning's walk."</p>

<p>"We have, Uncle Philip, and we thank you
much, and bid you, good day."</p>

<p>"Good day, boys."</p>

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Philip tells the Children about Animals
that can do Mason's Work.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Uncle Philip</span>, we saw a very strange
thing just now; as we were coming, we saw a
great many bees flying by us, and each one
was carrying a little stone."</p>

<p>"That was strange, indeed. Did you find
out any thing about them?"</p>

<p>"We asked a man who was near what they
did it for, and he said that they carried the
stones to prevent the wind, which is blowing
pretty fresh, from tossing them about too
much."</p>

<p>"That is a very silly story, boys, though it
is a very old one: for I have seen them carrying
what you call stones when it was quite
calm, and there was no wind to blow them
away. The man was very ignorant, or he
would have told you another story, which
would have been both strange and true."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you have the goodness, Uncle Philip,
to tell us what it meant?"</p>

<p>"Very willingly, boys. What you saw I
presume were bees. You remember that I
told you there were several kinds of bees;
and this one is called the mason-bee. This
kind builds his nest of mortar, and was therefore
called the mason-bee by Mr. Reaumur
first, I believe."</p>

<p>"Where does it get the mortar, Uncle
Philip?"</p>

<p>"It makes it, boys. This kind of bee may
be seen flying about, picking up sand, grain
by grain, putting it into a heap, gluing them
together with a sort of gum out of her own
mouth, and building with them a foundation
for her house. This little workman commonly
builds against the side of a wall between two
bricks where the mortar has fallen out; and
if you should see one of the nests, it appears
exactly like a lump of dry mud which has
been thrown wet upon the wall out of a cart-rut:
but when you examine it closely, you
may see a great many small stones in it, more
than is common in mud: a hundred people,
though, might pass by it, and never think it
was any thing more than a lump of dirt, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
had been thrown upon the wall when it was
wet, and had afterward dried there. Here is
a picture of one of these nests.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_072a.jpg" id="i_072a.jpg"></a>

  alt="Exterior wall of Mason-bee's Nest" />
  <div class="caption">Exterior wall of Mason-bee's Nest.</div>
</div>

<p>You see there is a small hole in it; this leads
to a cell inside about an inch deep, and shaped
exactly like a lady's thimble; the inside of
this cell is polished smooth, and appears like
a wall of plaster, except that it has little yellow
stains upon it. Here is the bee that
makes it.</p>

  <img src="images/i_072b.jpg"
  alt="Mason-bee" />
  <div class="caption">Mason-bee.&mdash;Natural size.</div>
</div>

<p>In making this mortar to build with, the bee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
will sometimes add earth that is soft to its
grains of sand, and when the lump is about
the size of a small shot, it takes it up and flies
away with it, to work it into the wall."</p>

<p>"Does it always use sand, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Not always: sometimes it takes wet clay,
and will dig into a bank of clay baked hard
by the sun on the outside, so as to get that
which is wet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rennie, a gentleman in England who
is very fond of watching insects, and has found
out a great many curious things about them,
has given an account of some of these bees
which he noticed at work. Every one was
carrying out of a hole in the clay-bank a small
lump of clay; and on catching one of them, he
found that this lump was wetter than the clay
in the hole, so that the bee had moistened it,
and worked it together, to make it stick like
good mortar. These lumps too were larger
than a shot; they were as large as a garden-pea."</p>

<p>"How long did it take them to work up the
lump?"</p>

<p>"About half a minute, Mr. Rennie says.
He watched one of these little creatures, and
found that she was building on the inside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
wall of a coal-house, where the bricks and
mortar were left rough: she was at work between
two of the bricks where the mortar
had fallen out, or where the bee had taken it
out. And the conduct of the bee at her house
was very different from what it was at the
clay-bank. She was not frightened, but went
on working when any one came near the
clay-bank; but at her house she seemed afraid
that it should be found out where it was.
She would alight first on the roof outside, as
if she merely wished to rest herself; and
when she flew into the coal-house she would
not go directly to her nest, but would settle
on a shelf, and sometimes pretend to be
examining a great many places in the wall
between different bricks; and at last, when
she supposed there was no risk, or when there
was nothing to alarm her, she would fly to
her nest, and go to work with all her might
in fixing her piece of clay to the wall."</p>

<p>"Why did she wish her house not to be
found out, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rennie supposed it was her instinct:
she had seen probably some of the insects
which would destroy her young, watching her
to see where she was building; and sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
after flying nearly to her nest with a load, she
would turn back and fly towards the clay-bank,
or take a large sweep off in another
direction, and so come to her house.</p>

<p>"Besides the mason-bee, boys, there is the
mason-wasp, which I have heard some persons
call the <i>dirt-dauber</i>: it is very common,
especially in the southern part of the United
States. It works very much like the mason-bee,
only it is apt to fix its nest under the
eaves of old houses, which I think the mason-bee
never does.</p>

<p>"There is also another kind of mason-wasp
which will actually break a hard brick. Mr.
Rennie says that he saw one at work on a
brick of a hard yellow kind. Whether the
wasp found a hole in the brick to begin with,
he did not know; but if he did he was hard
at work making it larger: he would break
off a piece as large as a mustard-seed at a
time. Here is a drawing of that kind of
wasp; and the insect is no larger than the
picture.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems wonderful that so small an insect
should have so much strength. Here is a
picture of its jaws, seen through a microscope,
so as to appear a great deal larger than they
really are.</p>

  <div class="caption">Jaws of Mason-wasp.&mdash;Greatly magnified.</div>
</div>

<p>"I do not know, boys, that the masons we
have been talking of, show us any <i>tools</i> like
those with which men who are masons work;
but they show us, at any rate, how to make
mortar by kneading or working it together;
and they certainly show us that we were not
the first who built walls. But there is another
kind of mason who works in stone.
He picks out the stones which are of proper
size, and he fastens them together with mortar
really as men do."</p>

<p>"Pray tell us of him, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"I will. The insect I mean is the caddis-worm,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
which is to be found sometimes in
ponds, and very often in springs of fresh
water. There are several sorts of them, but
the one I am thinking of now, builds a stone
house to live in. These worms are in the
habit of making a little tube, sometimes of
sand, or shell, or wood, or leaves, or stones,
to live in; and their skill consists in joining
these perfectly, and making them stick together.
But we are talking now of the caddis-worm
that uses stone. What the worm has
to do is to make a tube out of small stones,
that shall have a hollow about as large as a
wheat straw, and be perfectly smooth inside.
This is a pretty hard task&mdash;at least it would
be very hard to us. When the stone-mason
wishes a stone of a particular size or shape,
and cannot find it, he takes his hammer and
breaks one until it will suit; but the caddis-worm
has no hammer, and must take the
stones just as it finds them. The little insect
then has to pick out a great many stones
before he gets the right one, because they
have so many little rough points about them
that it is very difficult to get those which will
make the tube perfectly smooth inside. Remember,
too, that the bottom or lower side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
this stone case has to be pretty nearly smooth,
so that the worm can drag it along on the bottom
of the spring or pond (for it never comes
out of it), and you will see that the picking out
of the stones alone is no trifle. But besides
this, it has to fasten them together with mortar."</p>

<p>"And can the worm really do this, Uncle
Philip? Will not the water wash the mortar
all away?"</p>

<p>"It certainly would if it were like common
mortar. It was a long time that men lived
before they found out a mortar that would remain,
and grow hard under water. When
they want to build a wall that is to be under
the water, they use a cement which is called
pozzolana; it is made of lava out of a volcano,
and is water-proof. Our caddis-worm
has a cement too, which is better than pozzolana,
and though it has been tried, it cannot
be melted or dissolved in water. Here is a
drawing of the stone nest of a caddis-worm."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, you said that sometimes
these worms built their nests of other things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
besides stones; let us hear something of them,
if you please."</p>

<p>"Very willingly, boys. Some build of
shells: here are pictures of their nests.</p>

  <div class="caption">Reed Nest of Caddis-worm.</div>
</div>

<p>Some build of leaves, and others of pieces of
reed or light bark.</p>

<p>And a curious thing about those which build
of light pieces of bark or reed is this, that they
will make the top-piece come over so as to
hide their heads, and prevent you from seeing
them. Some build of sand; and then as the
house would be so light that the water running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
from the spring might wash it down and
carry it away, the wonderful little creature
takes care to anchor it by fastening a pretty
large stone to it when it has nearly finished it.
And as the worm anchors it when it is too
light, so it lightens it when it is too heavy,
by fixing a bit of light wood or hollow straw
to it to buoy it up."</p>

<p>"Well, this is truly a wonderful insect.
Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Truly so indeed, boys. In all these cases
it uses its water-proof cement, and if you break
its house to pieces, and will patiently watch,
you may see it build another. The insect
always lives with its head out of doors, and
its body inside; so that its head is firm and
hard, while its body is soft."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip," said one of the larger boys,
"there is one thing I have been thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
about, as you have been talking: these little
masons have no trowel, but I believe I know
of one animal that uses something like that
tool."</p>

<p>"Ah! What animal is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, I was reading the other day something
about the beavers building their dams
and their houses, and the book said that they
built their houses of logs first, and then plastered
them with mud, and that they used their
tails for trowels."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to find that you remember
what you read; but I am sorry that your book
did not tell you the truth. There have been
very strange stories told about the beaver;
and these stories have been taken from one
book and printed in another, so that an untrue
account has gone down for a great many
years. The beaver is very ingenious, but is
not quite so much of a mason as you suppose."</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Philip, will you tell us the
truth about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, I will, so far as I know it myself.
I have seen these animals, for they were once a
great deal more common in our country than
they are now; and many of the stories told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of them are not true. But before I begin, let
me tell you of one book which I think does
tell the plain truth about them; and the truth
is curious enough."</p>

<p>"What book is it, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"It is a book written on American Natural
History, by Doctor John Godman. I knew
him, boys, and a most excellent man he was.
He is now dead&mdash;and he died a Christian.
The book he wrote you will find worth reading,
when you get old enough to understand
it. But now for the beaver.</p>

<p>"His tail is very broad and flat at the end,
and might be used very well for a trowel; but
when he builds his house he does not cut down
trees, and place them first, and then fill up the
cracks with mud-mortar; but all the sticks
and mud (and stones too when the beaver can
get them), are first mixed up together, and the
beaver builds his house with this from the
very foundation. As soon as he has placed a
lump of this stuff upon the wall, he turns
round and gives it a blow with his flat tail;
and that, boys, is all he does with his tail for
a trowel. Sometimes he slaps his tail upon
the water when he is swimming; and some
persons have supposed that this was done by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the king, or ruler, to call his workmen. It
may be so, but I do not believe it, because they
almost always dive as soon as they have
slapped the water; and I think it is probably
a part of their motion in diving. In the
autumn they cover the outside of their houses
with mud, and they walk over it as they are
at work, and their tails drag along upon
it; and this I expect made persons first suppose
that they were plastering it, with the
tail for a trowel. When they are caught and
kept, boys, they still keep up this fashion of
slapping with the tail; so that I rather think
it is part of the nature of the animal.</p>

<p>"At another time, perhaps, I will tell you
more about the beaver; but it is now late,
and I must bid you good morning."</p>

<p>"Good day, Uncle Philip."</p>

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Philip talks to the Children about Animals
that throw Dirt with a Spade; and
about an Animal with a Hook; and about
one that is a Wire-drawer.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Boys</span>, I have some men at work digging
a small ditch for me, and I wish to see them;
will you go with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;very gladly, Uncle Philip; for
you will be sure to tell us of something curious
before we come home."</p>

<p>"Come on, then: yonder are the men at
work; they have been very industrious, I
see."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, look! There is one of
the men putting a bottle to his mouth. Is
that right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, right enough; for the bottle
has nothing but molasses and water in it;
and the man is thirsty, I suppose. I would
not employ him if he brought a bottle of
spirits out with him, for two reasons. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
first place, I think that I ought not to encourage
a man who gets drunk, by employing
him; for I would rather give my money to
a sober man who will not spend it for rum and
brandy, but will take care of his family: and,
in the second place, a drunkard would not
work faithfully without being watched all the
time. I never knew a drunkard who was
really and honestly an industrious man."</p>

<p>"See, Uncle Philip, how strong that man
is; what a large spadeful of dirt he throws
out!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see, boys: do you think that men
had the first spades in the world?"</p>

<p>"Ah! now you are going to tell us something
about tools among animals: that is
good; we like to hear of that. What animal
is it that has a spade?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a very common animal indeed in
some parts of our country. The country
people call it a <i>woodchuk</i>, and sometimes a
<i>ground-hog</i>: its right name is the marmot;
and as there are several sorts, ours is called
the Maryland marmot, to distinguish it; but
it is in New-York, Connecticut, New-Jersey.
Pennsylvania, Virginia, and some of the other
states, as well as in Maryland. This is rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
a mischievous animal, and does harm to the
clover-fields; but it is in making his house
that he uses his spade."</p>

<p>"Then he digs his house in the ground.
Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he burrows, or digs his nest in
banks of earth, or on the sides of hills; and
he has sense enough to make the passage to
the inside upwards, instead of downwards, so
that water cannot run in. In digging soft
earth he uses his fore-paws to loosen the dirt,
for his fore-legs are very strong; and if the
ground is hard he will use his teeth too. As
he gets farther in, he throws the dirt with his
fore-paws under his belly, and when he has a
heap gathered, he balances himself on his
fore-feet, and begins to throw it out with his
spades."</p>

<p>"What are his spades, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"His hinder feet, boys, which are very
broad, and just fit to take up the dirt as a
spade does, and to throw it from him: there
is a skin which grows between the toes of his
hinder feet, so that he can spread them out
when he chooses, like a duck's foot."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, perhaps they are made
so for the sake of <i>swimming</i>; the duck's are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a sensible thought, boys. Always
think for yourselves; and when you make a
mistake, try again: everybody is mistaken
sometimes. Let it teach you to be modest
and humble; but do not be afraid to think
again. A person who is always thinking
cannot <i>always</i> think wrong. Now you suppose
the marmot's feet may be made like a
duck's for swimming: let me tell you something
else, and we shall see what you will
think then. The marmot hates a rain as
much as you would if you had no umbrella;
he very seldom even drinks water, and then
only a little; and you cannot drive him into
a stream or pond; he is afraid of it. What
do you think now?"</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip, we think that he is
no swimmer."</p>

<p>"Very true, boys: so his feet, then, you
now think, were made for spades, and not for
paddles?"</p>

<p>"We do. Can you tell us any thing more
about this animal, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. The burrows or holes of the
marmot run a great distance under ground,
and end in several chambers or rooms, according
to the number that is to live in them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
They make beds in them of dry leaves, or
grass, or any thing soft and dry which they
can find. They cram their mouths full of it
to carry, when they are making their nests.
As soon as cold weather begins, the animal
goes into his house, and stops up the hole on
the inside; and there he stays till the warm
weather has come again.</p>

<p>"He is quite a thief at times. I saw one
once which a gentleman had tamed, and he
played about the yard; but every thing that
he could get hold of which was fit to make
his bed of, he was sure to steal, and carry
into his hole under ground. When clothes
were hung out to dry he would take them off
the line, and as soon as any were missed the
washerwoman knew very well where they
were. She kept a long stick with a hook at
the end of it, and with this she drew them out
of the burrow. He soon found out what it
meant, and whenever she used the stick, it
was necessary first to tie him up; for he did
not choose to have his bed spoiled, and would
run to the hole and try to get in, and prevent
the clothes from being drawn out. One day
he stole eight pairs of stockings, a towel, and
a little girl's frock; and he carried them into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
his burrow as far as six feet from the entrance.</p>

<p>"But, boys, as we have begun this morning
upon the old subject of tools among animals.
I will tell you of something which, though not
exactly a tool, is a very useful instrument,
and is found belonging to a very common
creature. Did you ever take notice of a
bat?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Uncle Philip, often, as they were
flying about in a room at night, but not
nearer."</p>

<p>"Then you never saw what I mean, I expect.
Our common bat, boys, has two very
excellent hooks; one on each of what you
call its wings: I say what you call its wings,
because the bat is not really a bird, but a
quadruped; that is, an animal with four feet:
and when it is on the ground, any one may
see that it is a four-footed animal. If a monkey's
paw should be flattened out very much,
it would be something like a bat's paw or
hand. The long finger-bones are just like
the sticks of an umbrella; there is a thin skin
between them, and they stretch it out, so that
the air underneath will keep them up. When
they are on the ground all this is folded up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Their hinder feet have five toes, all small, and
ending in sharp claws. On the fore-feet there
is but one finger which the bat can use much,
because the others are like umbrella-sticks, as
I told you; and the end of that one is a hook.
Here is a picture, in which you can see it
plainly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_090.jpg" id="i_090.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_090.jpg"
  alt="Bat foreleg with hook" />
</div>

<p>When the bat is on the ground, it is hard
work for it to get along. At first it will reach
forward a little to one side the hooked end of
its fore-leg, and stick it in the ground; then
it draws its hind-legs under its belly, and
raising itself up, just tumbles forward its whole
body. At the next step it stretches out the
other fore-leg, and hooks it, as it did before,
and drawing itself up, tumbles forward again.
The bat does not like a level place, because it
cannot raise itself in the air from it. When
they rest, they hang by the hooks; and here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
is a drawing of one, resting. In the other
picture which I showed you just now the
bat was flying."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_091.jpg" id="i_091.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_091.jpg"
  alt="Bat resting" />
</div>

<p>"Uncle Philip, we did not know before that
bats were such curious things; we always
thought that they were birds; but if these
pictures are like them, these hooks are as good
as fish-hooks."</p>

<p>"The pictures, boys, are very much like
the animal, and the hooks are just as plain
as they seem to be in the drawings. But
how often do you suppose that you have seen
a bat?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, many hundreds of times; for they
are very common."</p>

<p>"True, boys; and yet you never knew before
that they had hooks about them. Suppose
that everybody had done as you have,
just passed by the bats, without taking notice
of them; I could not have told you then
what strange creatures they are, for no person
would have known any thing about them.
You see, then, that men may have eyes, and
yet not see things; because they will not look
for them. Use your eyes, boys; God made
them to be used."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, bats are such ugly
things! and they can bite, too. We are afraid
of them."</p>

<p>"Ugly, boys! And what of that? Will
you look at nothing but what is handsome?
If the bat could think and speak, I expect he
would call you very ugly. But it is foolish,
boys, to be afraid of these smaller animals.
There are many creatures which might hurt
you, and I would advise you to keep out of
their way: but it is silly to be afraid of every
poor little insect or animal which you see. I
have seen a large boy cry when he saw a
poor little caterpillar or bug near him. Now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
there are very few insects, indeed, which can
or will hurt you; and a great many of them
you may watch without touching them at all.
And I think that he is a wicked and cruel boy
who kills every poor bug that he sees, merely
because he is stronger than the bug. It would
be a great deal kinder and wiser in the boy
to notice what the bug was doing, for then he
might learn something worth knowing."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, is it wrong to kill <i>spiders</i>?"</p>

<p>"Spiders! Why, boys, the spider is one
of the very last of these little creatures that
I should wish to kill. There is not a more
curious little animal in the world, nor one
that will pay a man better for watching its
motions. At some other time I will tell you
all about spiders and ants, for I have noticed
them a great deal: but now, just to show you
how much you would lose if you should kill
all the spiders, I will talk with you about a
tool which man uses, and which he might
have learned to make from a spider."</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell us; what is it?"</p>

<p>"The next time you go to Mr. Brown's, the
silversmith, ask him to show you his plate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
for drawing out wire. Tell him that I told
you to ask him, and he will show it to you.
You will see a flat piece of steel with holes
made through it in regular lines, beginning
with a large size, and growing smaller and
smaller until the last is very small indeed.</p>

<p>"Now the wire is drawn through these
holes; beginning at the larger ones, and passing
every time through the next smaller one,
it stretches the wire out, until it becomes as
small as the workman wishes it to be.</p>

<p>"The spider is a wire-drawer, too; for it
has a contrivance to draw out its threads, and
make them smaller or larger, as it pleases.
If you will look at a very large spider, you
can see with your naked eye, just at the end
of its body, four, and sometimes six, little
knobs like teats, with a circle around them.
These are its spinners. Each one of these
small knobs, inside of that circle, is so full
of little holes or tubes, that Mr. Reaumur
(of whom I told you before, you will recollect)
calculated that a place no larger
than the point of a pin had a thousand of
these little holes in it. These holes are
sometimes so very small, that another gentleman,
<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
who looked at spiders through a microscope
very often, thought it would take four
millions of the threads which came through
those holes to make one thread as thick as a
hair of his beard. Here is a picture of a spider
hanging by a thread coming out of its spinner,
or, as it is sometimes called, its spinneret."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_095.jpg" id="i_095.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_095.jpg"
  alt="Spider hanging by a thread" />
</div>

<p>"Then, Uncle Philip, the spider does not
spin its thread all at once?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, boys. Fine as you see that thread to
be, it is not one single line, but it is made of
many thousands joined together. The spiders
have little bags of gum within their bodies,
near their spinners, and out of these they
draw the threads: when they have come out
about the tenth part of an inch, they join
them all into one with their claws; and they
can shut their spinners when they please, so
as to make the threads longer or shorter; and
they can break them off, too, when they wish."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, we do not see why
there should be so many threads to make up
one."</p>

<p>"I cannot exactly tell you, boys, why there
are so many; but probably to make the thread
dry quicker, by letting the air touch so many
parts of it: and I expect, too, the thread is
stronger, because we know that in two pieces
of cord of one size, if one is made of several
smaller cords put together, it will be stronger
than the other, which was spun all at once.
The following is a picture of the spider's spinnerets,
and some of the threads as it appears
through the microscope; only you must recollect
that <i>all</i> the threads are not drawn:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
there are a great many more than you see in
the picture."</p>

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Philip tells the Children of a Door,
with a Hinge and Spring to it, made by
a Spider; and shows them Pictures to let
them see the Difference between God's
Work and Man's.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I was</span> thinking, boys, last night, of what
you said about killing the poor spiders; and
I was sorry that I did not then recollect one
thing about a spider which I could have told
you, and which would have made you like the
poor little creatures better. However, I determined
that when you came to see me again,
it should be the first thing I would tell you,
if you wished to hear it."</p>

<p>"Wish to hear it! Why, Uncle Philip,
we always wish to hear you tell us of any
thing that you please to talk about. You
have told us of a great many strange things,
about which we knew nothing before; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
we will thank you to tell us the story about
the spider."</p>

<p>"Very well, boys; you shall hear it. Pray,
do you not think that it is a piece of difficult
work to make a door to a house, and to make
hinges to hang it with, and to fit it so nicely
that when it is done you cannot see the joints
where the door is shut?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is a piece of very hard work.
Uncle Philip, and it takes the carpenter a long
time to do it; and it is hard work, too, for the
blacksmith to make the hinges. But what
has that to do with the story about the spider?"</p>

<p>"Patience, boys, patience: you shall know
presently. Never be in too great a hurry: it
is a bad plan. I have always noticed that
those persons who hurried most, went
slowest in the end. Another question I wish
to ask you is this,&mdash;do you not think it
was hard work for the first man who ever
made a spring, and put it on a door, to make
it shut itself again when it had been opened?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was so: and the man who does it
now gets well paid for it."</p>

<p>"Very good, boys. And now what will
you say when I tell you that a poor little spider
did all these things long before man did?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"What, Uncle Philip! A spider make a
door with a hinge and a spring to make it
shut itself!"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys; a spider. Do you think he
deserves to be killed for doing it?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no! But pray tell us all about it.
Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"This kind of spider, then, boys, I saw in
Jamaica, and I saw its house, too. It is called
the mason-spider. The nest or house which
I saw was a tube made of very hard clay,
about six inches long, and an inch across, and
was a little bent at one end. The inside of
this tube was lined all the way through with
a kind of soft silky stuff, something like silk-paper,
but stronger, and it was of a yellowish
colour; but the curious part was the door. I
never saw any thing which an insect had
made more strange than that. This door was
round, about as large as a quarter of a dollar,
and was a little hollowed on the upper side
like a saucer; the inside of it was rounded
like the outside of the saucer. It was of the
same stuff with the lining of the nest, and
seemed to be made of more than a dozen
pieces of that lining, put one on the top of another:
it was shaped so, too, that the inside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
layers or pieces were the broadest, and the
outside ones became smaller and smaller, except
at the hinge, which was about an inch
long. All the pieces in the door were joined
into this hinge, and then the hinge was joined
and worked into the lining in the tube.
That made the hinge the thickest and strongest
part of the whole work. How the spider
made it so, boys, I cannot tell; but so it was,
that this hinge not only was a hinge, but was
so good a spring, that whenever the door was
opened it would shut itself immediately:
and when shut, it fitted so nicely that it was
very difficult to see the place of joining."</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Philip, this is most wonderful!
But will not the hinge wear out at
last?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful as it is, boys, it is all true. As
to its wearing out, I cannot tell you; but I
know that a gentleman who had one, said
that his friends were very anxious to see it;
and there were so many of them, that he had
to open the door and let it shut itself many
hundreds of times to satisfy them; and it did
not hurt the spring at all."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, we shall not kill the poor
spiders any more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"A good resolution, boys: only let them
alone, and they will not hurt you. There is
another kind of mason-spider, which I never
saw, but I have read of it. It is found in the
south of France; I did not happen, however,
to meet with one while I was in that beautiful
country. This kind digs a gallery or
hole under ground as much as a foot deep.
She lines it with a sort of silk glued to the
walls, and makes her door, which is round
also, with many layers of mud or earth all
kneaded and bound together with some of
her silk. On the outside, the door is flat and
rough, to make it appear like the dirt around
it, and hide it; on the inside it is shaped like
the inside of the door of the other spider I
have told you about; and all covered with a
coat of fine silk. The threads of this silk are
left long on one side, and fastened to the upper
part of the hole; and these make the
hinge. There is no spring to this; but when
the spider pushes its door open and comes
out, it shuts again by its own weight. If this
door is forced open by any one when the spider
is at home, she will catch hold of it and
pull it in; and sometimes even when it is
half-opened; she will snatch it out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
hand. Here is a picture which shows the nest
open, and another of it shut; and there is a
drawing of the spider, too.</p>

</div>

<p>A gentleman says, in a book which he wrote
about insects, that he once broke one of these
doors off, to see what the spider would do."</p>

<p>"And what did she do, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"She made another door; but took very
good care not to put any hinge to it, for fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
she should be disturbed again. But when she
thought all danger was gone, she could then put
a hinge to it, you know; and probably she did."</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Philip, we thank you again
for this account of the spiders, and shall always
look at them hereafter with more pleasure.
Who would have thought that we should ever
find doors and hinges among such little creatures,
and these too so very well made and
fitted!"</p>

<p>"Why, boys, I have noticed the works of
God very often; and I will now tell you one
thing which I always found. It is this: a piece
of the very best work which man can make
is really coarse when you compare it with the
work of God. The poor spider that we have
talked about, when she makes her door, makes
it to fit perfectly; because in doing that one
thing, God made her to know perfectly how
to do it. The knowledge is God's, boys; but
the work is the spider's: but in making any
thing else, except about her house, the spider
knows nothing."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, you told us once that you
were very fond of watching all sorts of
dumb animals, and we think now that we
know the reason."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is because you see so much of God's
knowledge in them; is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear boys, it is. When I look at
many things which man makes or does, I
think to myself, 'Now this thing is likely to
have a mixture of sense and nonsense in it;
the sense is God's, and the nonsense is man's.'
But when I look at a thing made by one of
the dumb creatures for its own comfort and
safety, like the spider's house, with its door
and hinge, for instance, I say to myself, 'Now
here is the wisdom of God, without any of
man's nonsense.' And yet, boys, men are far
wiser than any other animal in this world."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, you said that a piece
of man's best work was really coarse: some
things must be neat, we should think. Is the
point of a needle coarse? It does not seem so."</p>

<p>"Boys, you have mentioned the very thing
which was in my mind when I spoke. The
point of the smallest needle is very coarse.
You have heard me talk of the microscope.
I told you it was a set of glasses, so fixed that
when you looked through them, it made small
things appear very large: on some other day,
perhaps, I will let you look through my microscope
for yourselves; but now, I just wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to show you the difference between the work
of God and that of man. Let us go home,
and I will show you some pictures I made,
and you can see in them the difference. Last
winter, you know, was very cold, and there
was a great deal of snow: one day, while the
snow was falling pretty fast, I was obliged to
go out; and as the flakes of snow fell upon
the sleeve of my coat (which was black), I
thought they had a curious shape, and did not
all appear alike; so when I returned home I
caught some of the flakes, and looked at them
through my microscope. They were so beautiful
that I made pictures of them; and as we
have now reached home, just let me step into
my study, and I will bring them to you. Here
they are, boys."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Philip! these are very pretty;
they are all so different, too!"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, I picked out different ones to
draw: when I was done, I began to look into
my books to find out what others had written
about this thing; and I found that a gentleman
named Dr. Hook had seen more than a
hundred different shapes and sizes of these
flakes. This is <span class="smcap">God's</span> work, boys.</p>

<p>"Now I have brought you out another picture:
it is the point of a very small needle,
seen through the very same microscope which
showed me the snow-flakes. Just look at it,

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Phillip tells the Boys a Story about a
Philosopher and his Kite.&mdash;He tells them,
too, about Ants that have Awls, and build
Cities, and Stairs, and Bridges, and many
other things.</i></div>


<p>"So, boys, you have come again to see me.
I am very glad of it; for as this is a leisure
day, we shall have time enough to talk: but
what is that you have there? Oh, I see now;
it is a kite."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Philip; it is a French kite that
we have been making, and we have come to
ask you to go out with us this morning and
see us fly it."</p>

<p>"Very good, boys; I will go. I am an old
man now; but I remember that I was a boy
once, and loved to make a kite sail. It always
makes me happy to see boys and girls playing
about in health, provided they are not wasting
time, and their play is not to do harm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to anybody or any thing. So come on; we
will go out upon the green common yonder,
behind the church, and I think we shall have a
grand kite-flying, for the wind is about right.</p>

<p>"There, boys! up she goes! Let out the
string. I think she behaves very well; there,
she is done pitching about: now she is steady;
see how she mounts. Ah, that is a very
good kite."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, I was reading a book yesterday
which said, 'A philosopher once found
great help from a kite.' What did it mean?"</p>

<p>"Do you know what a philosopher is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Philip; a philosopher is the
same thing with a very wise man, is it not?"</p>

<p>"That is pretty near the meaning. Philosopher
means a person who loves wisdom;
and such a person, you know, will always be
trying to get knowledge; and a person who
is always trying to get knowledge is apt to
be a wise and learned man."</p>

<p>"Well, how could a kite help a man to get
learning? Did he read the old newspapers it
was made of? I cannot see any other way."</p>

<p>"But there may be another way without
your seeing it, you know. The philosopher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
whom your book meant was Dr. Franklin.
Did you ever hear of him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he was born in Boston, and was
a printer, and afterward became a very great
man."</p>

<p>"That is true. He was a man of excellent
sense, who both read and thought a great
deal; and in the war which the people of this
country had with England to get their freedom.
Dr. Franklin's sound sense was of great
use to his countrymen."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, how did the kite help
him?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. If you take a proper piece
of glass, or sulphur, or sealing-wax, or rosin,
and rub it for some time, and then hold
it near to small bits of thread or paper, the
thread or paper will fly towards the glass or
sealing-wax, and stick to it for a short time.
That which makes them fly to the glass and
stick there, is called <i>electricity</i>. After this
was found out, men went on slowly finding
out more and more, until at last a man named
Hawksbee made a large machine with a glass
barrel, which could be turned around by a handle
like that which you see to a grindstone;
and with this machine (which I will show you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
at some other time) he managed to get a great
deal of this electricity, and it would shoot off
in sparks, which appeared like little lightning.</p>

<p>"And now, boys, what I am going to tell
you will show you the use of a man's eyes.
Dr. Franklin knew all about the electrical machine,
and was very fond of drawing off the
sparks from it, to see what he could find out
about it. And when he saw it appeared so
much like lightning, and could feel too a
spark strike his hand a smart blow, he began
to think that perhaps it was exactly the same
thing with the lightning which came from the
clouds; so he determined, if he could, to find
out whether it was or not. He was a great
deal troubled for some time to know how he
should get down any of the lightning from
the clouds; until at last, one day, he saw a
boy flying a kite; and that showed him the
way. So he took a large silk handkerchief,
and stretching it upon sticks, soon made his
kite; and not long afterward, when he saw a
black thunder-cloud coming up, he took his
kite and walked out of Philadelphia (where
he then lived) into the fields, and sent his kite
up. He had a string like yours, made of
hemp, and to the end of this he tied an iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
key, and then fastening it to the post of a shed
by a silk cord, which he tied to the end of the
hemp string, he got under the shed, and
waited a long time. Now, boys, if he had
been impatient, all his work would have been
of no use. But he even waited, after a very
heavy cloud had passed over his kite without
giving it any of its lightning. At last, when
he was almost ready to give it up and go
home, he saw some loose threads on the hemp
string rise and stand up straight, just as he
knew the electrical machine would make them
do. He directly put his knuckle to the iron
key, and off came the spark, which he knew
at once was exactly like the spark which he
could get from the machine. And so, boys,
he found out what he wished to know; and
this was the way in which the kite helped
the philosopher."</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Philip, this is really a very
pretty story about Dr. Franklin and his kite.
Was anybody with him?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but his son; he took him out to
help him raise the kite. But, boys, I see the
other lads are walking on towards the bridge
with our kite; let us follow them, and as we
go, I will tell you of an electric <i>animal</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we shall be very glad to hear of him."</p>

<p>"Listen, then. There is a kind of eel,
which when it is touched will give a very
hard blow, just like an electric shock, to the
person who touches it."</p>

<p>"Is there any spark, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"No, boys; there is no spark,&mdash;but the blow
is tremendous. I remember reading of one
of these fish which was caught in a net, and
a foolish sailor would take it up, though he
was told it would hurt him. The fish shocked
him so violently that he fell down in a fit,
and it was a long time before he came to his
senses; and his story was, that the moment
he touched the fish, 'the cold ran swiftly up
his arm into his body, and pierced him to the
heart.' The fish has this power to defend
itself, and to kill other fish for food."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, how do they ever manage
to catch them alive? I should think they
would be shocked to death."</p>

<p>"I will tell you. A very sensible traveller
and learned man<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> gives an account of the
manner in which they catch them, by a way
called, by the South American Indians, 'fishing
with horses.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fishing with horses! What does that
mean?"</p>

<p>"The savannas, or large open plains, in
South America have a great many wild horses
and mules running over them. M. Humboldt
says that the Indians caught about thirty of
these, and drove them into the pond where
the electrical eels were. The horses made a
great noise, and stirred up the mud with their
hoofs, and this brought up the eels from the
bottom in a great rage. They were very
large, and looked more like water-snakes than
like eels; and rising to the top of the water,
they crowded under the bellies of the horses
and mules, and began to shock them. The
poor horses would try to get out of the pond;
but the Indians, with spears and long reeds,
would stand around to hinder them from coming
out: some of them, too, would climb
upon the trees around the banks, and get out
upon the branches which were over the pond,
and by crying out aloud, and using their long
reeds, kept the horses in the pond. The eels
would continue to shock them with tremendous
blows, and a great many of the poor
creatures were either stunned or killed, and
would sink. Those not killed would pant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and raise their heads, while their eyes would
show their pain, and they would try to get
out. The Indians still drove them back, but
some few escaped, and reached the shore,
stumbling at every step, and would stretch
themselves on the bank, tired out, and benumbed
in their limbs by the shocks they
had received. M. Humboldt says that in less
than five minutes after the fight began, two
horses were drowned; and he thought that
the end of it would be, that every horse which
did not get out of the water would be killed:
but at last the eels became tired, and began
to disperse. This is just what the Indians
wish. They know that the eels have spent
so much of their electrical power that they
will need a long rest. It takes them a great
while to get back their strength; so that if,
the next day after such a fight, you send in
more horses, they cannot kill one. When
the eels, tired out in this way, begin to separate,
they will swim to the edge of the pond,
and there the Indians take them with small
harpoons fastened to long cords. When the
cords are dry, the Indian feels no shock in
raising the eel out of the water. In this way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
M. Humboldt got five, all alive, and very little
hurt. But here we are at the bridge."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, suppose we sit down under
the shade of this tree, and rest."</p>

<p>"I am willing, boys; but take care of the
damp ground: there is an old piece of timber
that the men have taken out of the bridge, for
I see they have been mending it; we will sit
on that."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, what shall we do with
the kite? shall we draw it down?"</p>

<p>"Do with it! Why, just tie the end of
your string to that root, and it will take care
of itself in this wind."</p>

<p>"What a monstrous piece of timber this is.
Uncle Philip! It must have taken a great
many men to move it; and see&mdash;there are
some larger ones still in the bridge. It must
be a difficult work to build a bridge."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is so: but there are bridges much
harder to build than our little wooden one
here. Some are built of stone, and it takes
years to finish them. None but a good workman
can plan and build a good stone bridge:
but I know a little fellow that can make as
good a bridge as anybody; and yet no man
ever taught him the trade."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! now we know what is coming.
You are going to tell us of a dumb animal
that can make a bridge."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am: and a small animal it is, too,
for it is an ant."</p>

<p>"What sort of an ant is it?"</p>

<p>"It is called the white ant; and as there is
a great deal that is very curious about this insect.
I think that I had better tell you all about
it at once."</p>

<p>"Pray do, Uncle Philip; you know you
promised to tell us about ants."</p>

<p>"True, boys; and I like to keep my promises.
In my story about these ants, I think, if
you attend, you will find more tools; and besides
that, you will hear of a great many
things which man makes, and which show
matters quite as strange as any of which I
have yet told you."</p>

<p>"What are they, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"They are the building of something like a
city, and bridges, and stairs, and roads, and
tunnels under ground, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, let us hear&mdash;let us hear! We have
heard nothing equal to this yet."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I begin by telling you that
these insects are very common in Africa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and in the East Indies, and are troublesome
enough, for they eat almost every thing but
metal and glass. They love wood, though,
better than any thing else; and they are
so numerous that they destroy it wonderfully
fast. They are very cunning, too; they never
eat the outside of the wood first, but will
work upon the inside, so as to leave the outer
part not thicker than a piece of pasteboard.
But the curious things I meant to tell you
were about their city; so I will go on to that.
When they first begin to build you will see
little hills shaped like a sugar-loaf, and rising
up above the ground about a foot, or a little
more. Here is a picture of them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_118.jpg" id="i_118.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_118.jpg"
  alt="Hills shaped like a sugar-loaf" />
</div>

<p>The highest of these little hills is always in
the middle; and they go on building more
and more, and making them all higher, still
keeping the tallest one in the centre. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
they have made them as high as they wish,
then they fill in the spaces between the tops
of all these sugar-loaf hills, so as to make one
roof over all. Here is a picture of one finished.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_119.jpg" id="i_119.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_119.jpg"
  alt="Finished sugar-loaf hill" />
</div>

<p>After this is done, they take down nearly all
of the little sugar-loaf hills inside; for they
only wanted them for a scaffold to support the
top while they were building it."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, what is all this built of?"</p>

<p>"It is built of clay, which the ant makes
almost as hard as stone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are they strong, Uncle Philip?</p>

<p>"So strong, boys, that five men may stand
on them; and it is a common thing for the
wild bulls to get upon them and look out,
while the rest of the herd are feeding below."</p>

<p>"Why, how high are they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of different heights; some as many
as five or six feet, others are twelve, and the
largest are as high as twenty feet, and would
easily hold a dozen men."</p>

<p>"And how large are the ants, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Not above a quarter of an inch high as
they stand. Now, boys, just compare the
size of one of these nests with the size of the
ant that made it; and it is quite as large in proportion
as the city of New-York is when compared
to a man's size; yes, it is a great deal
larger in proportion. These nests are sometimes
five hundred times as high as the ants
which build them: now suppose that men
built their houses five hundred times as high
as themselves, and as large at the foundation
in proportion to their height, what monstrous
buildings they would be! But let me go on.
This outside shell, which I have been telling
you how they make, is nothing but the wall
of the city; the buildings are all inside of
that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, there is one thing I
have been thinking of which would make it
more like a city still. But I hardly think they
can have that."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Why in a city, you know, where there are
a great many people, there are a great many
trades: some do one thing and some do another
to get money."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true; and I am glad that you
mentioned it, because it reminds me of one
thing I intended to tell you about these ants.
Now, it would not be reasonable, you know,
to expect the ants to have many different kinds
of business to do, as the people in New-York
have; but still, boys, they are not all alike,
and they do have work of different kinds.
There are in the city of the white ants a king
and a queen, and soldiers, and labourers, or
workmen, and all these are different. Here
are pictures which will show them all to you.
This is the king.</p>

<p>At first he has four wings, but soon loses
them. He never grows any larger after he
loses them. The king may be known by his
having two large eyes. Here is the queen.
She is the mother of the whole city; and you
see what a large body she has. It is full of
eggs, and eighty thousand will come from her
in twenty-four hours. She also has two eyes.</p>

  <img src="images/i_122a.jpg"
  alt="Queen of the termites" />
  <div class="caption">Queen of the Termites.</div>
</div>

<p>"Here is a soldier: he has a large head,
armed with two hooks, shaped like a crooked
awl, and very sharp.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_122b.jpg" id="i_122b.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_122b.jpg"
  alt="Soldier of the termites" />
  <div class="caption">Soldier of the Termites.</div>
</div>

<p>"For every one of these soldiers there are
about one hundred labourers. The soldiers
do the fighting; and though they are perfectly
blind, they fight well, and are very brave.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The following is a picture, too, of the soldiers'
awls, seen through the microscope, to show
you how sharp they are.</p>

<p>"And here is a picture of the labourer; the
largest part of the city is made up of the labourers,&mdash;which
shows us, I think, boys, that
there is more need of working than there is
of fighting.</p>

<p>This class, like the soldiers, is blind, and
scarcely ever go into the open air; their work
is mostly under ground or in the inside of
wood. Both, however, do come out when
their city is attacked and broken: but I will
tell you of that presently."</p>

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Philip tells the Children more about the
White Ants.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span>, boys, as I have told you about the
kinds of different work which these ants do,
we will go on, and I will tell you about the
inside of the city. The first thing to be done
is to build a house for the king and queen.
This is the first house built in the city, and
always stands in the centre, directly under
the point of the roof or top of the outside wall.
It is built nearly on a level with the ground,
and is shaped very much like a long oven, or
the half of an egg split through the long way.
The floor is exactly level, and about an inch
thick; the roof is about the same thickness.
The doors are on a level with the floor, and
just large enough to let one of the labourers
go in."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip, how do the king and
queen ever get out then."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"They never do get out, boys; they live in
that house always, and they are not the first
kings and queens who have found that a
palace is sometimes a prison. Just around
this house of the king and queen are other
houses built of clay, arched at the top, and of
different shapes. These are for the servants
or labouring ants, who remove the eggs of the
queen as fast as she discharges them. The
soldiers also live in these houses. Next to
these are the magazines, that is, the houses
where they keep their food, such as dry juices
of trees and gums; and mixed up with these are
the nurseries. These are made by the labourers,
and are different from all the other buildings,
for they are made of wood gnawed or
broken into fine threads, and joined together
with some kind of gum, and around each of
them there is a case of clay. These nurseries
are to carry the eggs into for the young
ants to be hatched. Between all these different
houses or parts there are thousands of
galleries or ways, which run among them and
separate them from each other, and these
may be called the streets of the city. These
streets run in all directions, and extend as far
as the outside wall; and houses are built on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
top of houses, and streets run over streets,
until they reach up as high as two-thirds of
the inside wall. But under the top of their
outside case they always leave a large open
place that is never filled up with houses. And
around this space they will build three or four
large arches, sometimes two or three feet high;
these I suppose are to prevent the houses from
falling in towards the centre of the city, which
is an open space, and on the other side they
are fastened to the outside walls, so that these
houses are very firm."</p>

<p>"And what is all this made of, Uncle
Philip?"</p>

<p>"All of clay, except the nurseries, which I
told you were made of wood and gum. Over
the house of the king and queen there is a
sort of flat floor, some distance above it, with
nurseries and magazines between the under
side of it and the top of the queen's house.
This floor will not let the water through it,
so as to wet the palace where the king and
queen live, but will turn it off into large
trenches or gutters under ground, of which
I will speak directly. The bridge I told you
of they build from this floor in the open
space, directly under the top or dome of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
outside wall; it rises up and is joined to some
hole in the side wall of the houses above it."</p>

<p>"How large is it, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Why, sometimes it is half an inch broad,
a quarter of an inch thick, and ten inches
long; all made of clay, so that it is very strange
how they manage to join it to the wall without
its falling down by its own weight while
they were building it."</p>

<p>"And what do you suppose this bridge is
for, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think there can be no doubt what
it is for. When the city has been growing
for some time, some of the nurseries will be
very high up above the queen's house; but the
labourers have to carry her eggs into them,
no matter how far off they may be. If they
carry them through all the streets, they will
have to walk as many as fifteen or twenty
feet, for it would be five or six feet in a perfectly
straight line, and these streets are very
crooked; but if they make a bridge in the
open space in the centre, they can then go
from the queen's house over the bridge, and
get to the upper nurseries without travelling
more than two feet. So they made the bridge
to shorten the way, to be sure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is very wonderful: but you said something
about large trenches or gutters underground;
what are they, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"These galleries lead from the city under
ground, and are as large as the bore of a large
cannon; they are thirteen inches across, and
more than a hundred yards long. I have
already told you that the labourers never come
out into the light, when they can help it; and
these underground ways are the great roads
to the city, to fetch in clay, or wood, or water,
or provisions: and now I will tell you another
thing which shows a great deal of sense.
As some of their houses are very high up, you
know they would find it very hard to climb
up through all the streets with a heavy load
in a straight line; so when these large ways
underground reach the outside wall, they just
come through and keep on winding around
the inside of it like a corkscrew all the way
to the top; and there are other galleries opening
from it at different places into the city.
One thing has been noticed about these ants;
they can scarcely climb at all up a perpendicular
wall. Therefore on the upright
side of any part of the city you may see a
road made, standing out from the wall like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
a ledge; it is flat on the top, and half an
inch wide, and goes up gradually like a stair-case,
or like a road cut out on the side of a
mountain.</p>

<p>"Here is a picture of one of their cities cut
straight down through the middle. At the
bottom, in the centre, is the queen's house;
over it is a floor, and the two crooked things
you see rising up from the floor, are bridges."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, you said you would tell
us about the soldiers and labourers coming
out when the city is attacked."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. As soon as a hole is made in
the outside wall, you will see a soldier run
out, and walk about as if to look around; but
as he is blind, it cannot be to see what the
danger is. He may have some way though of
finding out without seeing. Presently he will
go in, as if to tell the others, and then out
pour the soldiers in great numbers, as fast
as the hole will let them; and just as long
as you strike the outside wall, they will
continue to rush out. They seem to be in
a terrible passion. They are in such a hurry
that sometimes they slip, and roll down
the outside of the hill; but they jump up
again instantly, and begin to bite every thing
they run against, for they are blind and cannot
tell a friend from an enemy."</p>

<p>"Do they bite hard, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Very hard indeed. They make their
hooked jaws, which are like awls, you know,
meet at every bite; and if it should happen to
be a man's leg they get hold of, you would see
upon his stocking a spot of blood an inch long.
At every bite too you may hear their jaws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
snapping together and making quite a noise.
Some of them too (perhaps they are the officers)
are constantly beating with their awls upon the
outside wall, and make a sound something
quicker and sharper than the ticking of a watch.
You may hear it at a distance of three or
four feet. When these biters lay hold, nothing
will make them let go; you must tear them
away by pieces. After you stop striking the
wall, in about half an hour they seem to get
over their rage and go back into the city, and
then out come the labourers. While the noise
continues you will not see one of them; they
all fled at the first appearance of danger. But
now they come, each one with a bundle of
mortar in his mouth, ready made; and they
stick it on the hole so fast, and with such
order, that though thousands and thousands
are at work they never interrupt each other.
And while the labourers are busy, if you look
you may commonly see a soldier or two walking
about; but they never touch the mortar,
nor help in any way to mend the hole. One
of these soldiers always stands near the spot
where the labourers are at work, and every
now and then turns slowly around, and frequently
lifts up his head, and with his awls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
beats upon the building, and makes a sort of
hissing noise. As soon as that is done you may
hear a loud hiss from all the labourers, both on
the outside of the wall and from the inside of
the city, and then the labourers run faster, and
work as quick again. If you attack the nest
again, away run all the labourers as fast as
their legs will carry them, and out pour the
soldiers as before; and the same thing is
always seen upon every attack, of soldiers
to fight and labourers to work."</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Philip, this is a very strange
story; much more interesting than any we
have yet heard."</p>

<p>"I thought it would please you, boys; but
there are still stranger things among animals,
and perhaps you will say so when you know
more.</p>

<p>"But it is now time to return home; so take
in the kite and let us be going."</p>

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Philip tells the Children about some
other Ants, that are very good Masons, and
build Walls and Ceilings; and a Story
about a very sensible Ant, which seemed to
think a little.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Good</span> morning, good morning, Uncle Philip;
we have been so much delighted with
the stories about the white ants, that we hope
you have more of the same kind to tell us."</p>

<p>"Why, as to that matter, boys, I can tell
you much more about ants, for there are many
kinds of them; but I am not sure that I can
show you any of the <i>tools</i> with which they
work, though a large portion of their work
is like that of man; and they have, too, several
customs which our fellow-creatures have.
I can tell you, however, of several other
animals which do use tools shaped like those
used by men, if you would rather hear of
them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you please, Uncle Philip, we will hear of
them at another time; but now we would rather
have you tell us of the other kinds of ants."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, boys; it shall be as you
wish. All that I desire is to instruct and
amuse you, and I am sure that the ants can
furnish a good lesson to us. I shall begin
with the mason ants. They always build
their nests either of clay which is damp, and
dug from the inside of their city under ground,
or which has been made wet by the rain; and
a part of their building is always above the
ground, so that you can easily see it. There is
no fixed rule for the ants to build by. Their
cities are not all alike in the inside. Sometimes
the walls are larger and coarser, and the
ways and galleries are higher, than at other
times. The rooms, too, are different in shape
and size, so that this industrious little insect
seems to have sense enough to work in the
best way according to circumstances. There
is only one general rule which they seem to
have, and that is always to build in a number
of different stories, one above the other. If
you examine one of these stories you may
see a number of large places or halls, some
smaller rooms, and some long galleries which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
serve as passage-ways. The tops of these
large halls are covered with an arched ceiling,
and this ceiling is held up, sometimes by little
columns, sometimes by very thin walls, or by
props built against the side walls, just like buttresses.
There are also chambers which have
but one door, which opens into the lower
story, and large open places in the centre of
the nest something like a cross road, and all
these little galleries or streets come into that
open place."</p>

<p>"Any bridges, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"No, boys; no bridges among these ants, so
far as I know. There will sometimes be as
many as twenty stories above ground in the
ant-hill, and as many below. The best time
to see these little fellows at work is in a gentle
shower of rain, or directly after."</p>

<p>"Why do they work in the rain, Uncle
Philip?"</p>

<p>"I suppose, boys, it is because the earth is
then better for them; and one thing that has
been noticed about their work is, that the rain,
when it is not too violent, seems to make it
solid, for these ants have no gum or glue
about them like some other insects, to make
the earth stick together. As soon as the rain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
begins, if you watch the brown ants, you may
see them come out of the ground in great
numbers; and then running in again, they
will soon return, each one with a little piece
of dirt in his mouth, which he puts down
upon the roof of the nest. A gentleman who
watched them very closely<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> says, that at first
he could not think what this was done for, but
at last he saw little walls begin to rise up
with spaces left between them. In some
places pillars were begun, placed at regular
distances, and he knew that these were to
support ceilings; so he found out that they
were going to build another story to their
house, and they were laying the foundations."</p>

<p>"How I should have liked to see them.
Uncle Philip. I would not have cared for the
rain."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see you are fit to be a naturalist.
You know what that word means, do you
not?"</p>

<p>"It means, Uncle Philip, a man who loves
to study about the animals and insects, does
it not?"</p>

<p>"It means a man or a woman either, boys,
who loves to study the things in nature no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
matter whether they are animals, or stones,
or grass, or flowers, or any of the things
which God has made. Mark, boys, I said to
study the things, and you said to study <i>about</i>
the things. Now a person may read a great
deal that is interesting and true about all
these things in books; and it is very well to
do so; but I think that the real naturalist
will never be satisfied with books only; he
will be looking to see things for himself. And
I said a woman might be a naturalist, because
some ladies have been fond of natural history,
and have proved themselves to be very good
naturalists. But let us go back to the ants.
Mr. Huber, in the account which he gives of
his having watched these little workmen,
never thought of telling us whether he got
wet or not, because he was too busy to think
or care much about it. He had an opportunity
of seeing what he might never see
again, and a little rain was not to spoil it.
He says that each ant, as it brought out its
little lump of dirt, would place it on the spot
where it wished it to be, and press against it
with its teeth, so as to make it fit closely. It
then rubbed its feelers all over it, and after
that pressed upon it lightly with its fore-feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
The walls went on very rapidly, and it often
happened that two little walls, which were to
make a passage or gallery, would be raised
opposite and at a small distance from each
other. When they were about a quarter of
an inch high, the ants would set to work and
cover them with an arched ceiling. After
they had raised all the walls as high as they
wished, on the inside of each wall at the top
they began to put in pieces of wet dirt almost
level, and in such a way as to make a ledge;
and by joining on more dirt to it, it would
meet the ledge made from the opposite wall
so as to make a roof: these roofs over the
galleries were about a quarter of an inch
across. The ceilings over the large halls
were sometimes as much as two inches in
breadth, and to support these they raised
pillars; and beginning in the corner where
two walls joined, they would commence the
ceiling with a ledge, while from the top of
each pillar they would also build out a layer
of earth a little rounded on the top; these
they continued to add to until all met and
made a complete cover for the hall."</p>

<p>"I wonder it did not fall, Uncle Philip, before
they could join it together."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Huber says that he thought several
times it would fall, from the rain which was
dropping upon it all the time; but he found
that the pieces held together, and that the
rain, instead of hurting it, only made it more
solid. All that it wants, when the ants have
done, is a little heat from the sun to bake it
hard, and then it appears like a piece of solid
dirt. Sometimes, if the rain be violent, the
apartments will be destroyed, especially if the
arches are not built strongly; and when this
happens, the little creatures go to work very
patiently and rebuild them."</p>

<p>"And how long, Uncle Philip, did it take
the ants to put another story on their house?"</p>

<p>"Between seven and eight hours; and they
had hardly finished one before they began another,
but they had not time to finish it, for
the rain stopped before they had built much:
however, they kept on, taking advantage of
the wet earth; but a cold drying wind soon
sprang up, and the earth would not stick; so
they stopped: but what do you think they did
with the new story which they had not time
to finish?"</p>

<p>"What <i>did</i> they do, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Pulled every part of it to pieces, and scattered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the dirt here and there over the roof of
the story which they had finished.</p>

<p>"I will tell you another story about these
ants, boys, which I think is most wonderful,
because it appears so much like reason.
These insects all seem to work separately,&mdash;I
mean without attending to the work of others:
of course sometimes the work done by
different ants on opposite sides of the same
gallery or hall will not suit: one wall will be
higher than the other, so that the ceilings will
not meet. Mr. Huber saw just such a case;
the ceiling which was begun from one wall
would just have reached the other wall about
half-way up; and while he was wondering
how the ants would cure the fault, one of
them came, and looking at the work, seemed
to know that it was wrong, and immediately
began by taking down the ceiling from the
lower wall; he then raised it to the same
height with the opposite wall, and made a
new ceiling in Mr. Huber's presence with the
pieces of the old one."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, if that ant did not know
how to think, I am mistaken."</p>

<p>"I must confess, boys, it does seem very
much like thinking; and if it was not thinking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
we must at any rate own that it was
something which, <i>in this case</i>, did quite as
well; for no thought of man could have hit
upon a better plan. But if the ant knew how
to think as a man does, do you suppose it would
ever have made the mistake? Would not
the workmen have all agreed beforehand what
they were to do, and how it should be done,
so that there might be no need of pulling
down any of the work because it would not
suit? I think that this story, boys, while it
shows us something like reason in <i>one</i> particular
instance, shows us also that <i>in general</i>
the ant has not reason like ours. But I am
tired now, and can tell you no more this
morning. When you come again I shall be
ready to talk with you about some other kinds
of ants. But before you go, tell me&mdash;can any
of you inform me what the Bible says about
the ant?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Uncle Philip: it says, 'Go to the
ant, thou sluggard, consider her ways, and be
wise.'"</p>

<p>"Well, another question. Have you any
lessons to say when you go into school on
Monday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Philip; we have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you learned them, boys?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then remember what the Bible says to
the sluggard, and go and learn them at once.
Good-by, children."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Uncle Philip: we will learn our
lessons."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, my lads, how do you do to-day?"</p>

<p>"Very well, Uncle Philip, we thank you.
And we wish to let you know that we kept
our promise to learn our lessons. Our teacher
was very well satisfied with every one of us."</p>

<p>"That is well, boys. I am truly glad to
hear this from you: and I make no doubt
that you also felt a great deal happier than you
would have done had you neglected to learn
your lessons. Did you not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes, Uncle Philip, much happier; and
far more cheerful and good-natured."</p>

<p>"Such are apt to be the feelings, boys, of
those who have done their <i>duty</i>. I am verily
persuaded that there is no such thing as real,
solid happiness in this world, but in that man
who acts from a sense of duty. His is true
peace, because it is 'the peace of God.' I do
not say, boys, that a man, even when he does
his duty, <i>always</i> feels comfortable or happy <i>at
once</i>; but he will be more apt to feel so than
if he did not do his duty: and I do say that
no man who does not act from a sense of duty,
is likely to feel any thing like happiness very
often or very long."</p>

<p>"Then, Uncle Philip, a man who wishes to
be happy will try in the first place to find out
what his duty is."</p>

<p>"To be sure, he will; and he need not try
very long either, if he really wishes to know
it. The will of God, boys, is at the bottom of
all our duties; and an honest man, yes, or
boy either, can commonly tell what God will
think to be right or wrong in his conduct.
You know where a great many of our duties
are very plainly written down for us; do you
not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir; in the New Testament, which
tells us of what our Saviour said and did."</p>

<p>"True. And what our Saviour commanded,
boys, God commanded; for He is
God. But besides this, when it is not exactly
written down in the New Testament what we
should do, still if we will think, we shall very
often find out what to do, from what is
written."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, we almost always know
what you mean; but now, we do not quite
understand you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, boys, for telling me that you
do not know what I mean: always tell any
person who is trying to teach you something,
when you do not understand what is said to
you. Now I will try to make what I said
plainer to you. The New Testament does
not say any thing about your going to school;
does it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Who sends you to school, boys, and pays
your teachers for instructing you?"</p>

<p>"Our parents, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Very well. Now suppose that John Carter
here, should wish, instead of going to school,
to do, what I am very sure he never did do:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
suppose he should determine to play the truant.
The Bible does not say a boy shall not
play the truant, does it?"</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"But if John Carter should play the truant,
he would, in doing so, disobey what God has
commanded in the Bible just as much as if
the Bible did say 'A boy shall not play the
truant;' for the Bible does say, '<i>Children
obey your parents</i>,' and he could not be a
truant without disobeying his parents, who
bade him go to school."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, we understand you very well
now."</p>

<p>"There is another thing I wish you to understand,
boys. John Carter, as you see,
would not only disobey his parents, which is
wicked, but he would also commit a <i>sin</i> against
God. That is always the thing to look at first.
When we are going to do something that we
are not very sure is right, we should always
stop to ask ourselves whether God will be
pleased with it. But I have said enough to
you about our duty for this time. Now for
the ants I promised to tell you of. And the
first sort I shall mention are great fighters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fighters, Uncle Philip! What do they
fight about?"</p>

<p>"About trifles, boys, just as men do. They
have terrible wars, and will dispute with and
kill each other for a few inches of dirt, when
certainly this world is large enough for them
all. But animals wiser than ants, boys, act
in the same foolish way. Men sometimes
go to war and kill each other to determine
who shall have a river, or a small town, or a
fort, or some little spot of ground; while the
poor creatures who do the fighting, and get
all the wounds, and lose their lives, had they
been let alone, would have lived on in peace,
and never cared a straw who had the miserable
little spot they fight for. But let me go
on with the account of these ants. In the
forests, where the fallow ants live, you may
see these wars. The battle will be between
the ants of different hills, but they are all
ants of the same sort. Thousands and thousands
of them will meet on the ground between
their hills, and the battle begins by two
ants, who seize each other by the claws (or
<i>mandibles</i>, as they are called), and rising up
on their hind-legs, they bring their bodies near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
together, and spirt a sort of venomous or
poisonous juice upon each other. These will
be followed by thousands of others on both
sides, who seize each other in the same way,
and fight in pairs&mdash;ant to ant. Sometimes
they will get so wedged together that they
fall down upon their sides, but they do not
let go on that account; they keep on fighting
in the dust until they rise on their feet again.
Sometimes, too, a third ant will come in, and
joining whichever of them belongs to his
nest, the two will begin to drag the third,
until some of his friends come to his help;
and in this way, others joining on both sides,
they will form strings of six, or eight, or ten
on a side, pulling with all their strength.
And while some are fighting, you will see
others leading off prisoners towards their
hills, while the prisoners are trying to escape.
The field of battle is not more, perhaps, than
three feet square; multitudes of dead ants
covered with venom may be seen upon it,
and there is a very strong scent which comes
from it. When night comes they go off to
their hills. Before dawn the next day they
are at it again in still larger numbers, and
they fight with greater fury than before, until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
at last one side or the other gives way. They
are so busy that even if you stand near them
they take no notice of you, and not one stops
fighting, or crawls up your legs."</p>

<p>"Do all of them that belong to the hill go
out to fight, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"No; near the hills all is peace and order,
and work seems to be going on as usual.
Only on the side next to the battle, crowds
may be seen running backwards and forwards
from both hills; some as messengers, I suppose,
and some to fight, or carry back prisoners."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, you said that these ants
were all of one sort; how then do they know
one another so as to tell which party each
one belongs to? I should think that sometimes
they would make a mistake, and fight
a friend instead of an enemy."</p>

<p>"This, boys, is one of the most wonderful
things concerning them. They are alike in
form, and size, and weapons, and strength;
and sometimes it happens that they do make
a mistake, but it is very seldom; and when
they do, Mr. Huber, who watched one of their
battles, says that they find it out directly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
caress each other with their feelers, and make
up the difficulty at once.</p>

<p>"Are you tired, boys, or do you wish to
hear more?"</p>

<p>"Oh, let us hear more, by all means: we
are not at all tired."</p>

<p>"I will then tell you of another kind of
ants called legionary ants, and sometimes
amazons; but I am sorry to say that they
are unlike other ants, for they are lazy; and
yet they live very comfortably."</p>

<p>"How is that, Uncle Philip? Can they
be comfortable without working?"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, if they can get others to work
for them; and these have their work mostly
done by their slaves."</p>

<p>"By their slaves! what are their slaves, and
where did they get them?"</p>

<p>"As to your first question, boys, their slaves
are ants of another kind; as to the second
question&mdash;where they get them&mdash;they <i>stole</i>
them when they were young."</p>

<p>"Why you surprise us, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"I dare say I do. There are persons much
older than you are who have never attended
at all to the doings of insects, who would be
very much astonished by the history of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
legionary ants; and probably would laugh at
the whole account as an idle story; and yet
it is all true, and those who have read and
seen, know it to be true; and they know, too,
that to deny it shows nothing but ignorance.
However, I always let such persons alone. I
can do them no good; for they are apt to be
very conceited, and will not be convinced.
And now for the legionary ant. This is a
fighting ant, as well as the last I mentioned;
and it actually steals the young of another
kind, rears them, and puts all the work on
them, so as to be idle itself. This curious
fact was first found out by Mr. Huber; another
gentleman, named Latreille, afterward
saw the same thing; and now a great many
naturalists know it, because they have sought
for and seen it. The ant which it steals is
of a dark ash colour; the legionary is of
light colour. The dark-coloured ant is
now called the negro ant, and is a very industrious,
peaceable insect, without any sting.
The legionary is a strong, brave ant, with a
sting, but very lazy. I shall relate to you
the account which Mr. Huber gives of the
legionary. He was walking near the city of
Geneva during an afternoon in the summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of 1804, when he saw quite an army of these
legionary ants crossing the road; they passed
through a thick hedge, entered a pasture, and
kept on through the grass without separating;
and Mr. Huber followed them until he saw
them come near a nest of negro ants. Some
of these negro ants seemed to be guarding
the holes into their nest; but as soon as they
saw the legionaries, they, with a great many
more from the inside of the nest, attacked the
thieves. The legionary ants, however, were
too powerful for them, and after a short but
severe fight they conquered the negroes, who
ran into the lower part of their nests. The
legionaries then mounted their ant-hill, some
entered it by the holes already made, and others
began with their teeth to break other holes,
so that all the army might get into the hill.
They went in and remained but a few minutes,
when they came out, each one having
in his mouth a young negro ant, and off they
scampered, without any order among them,
every one going his own way, until Mr.
Huber lost sight of them. The next day he
set out to go back and examine further, and
on his way he found a large ant-hill full of
legionaries, and saw an army start from it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
which he followed. They made the attack
as before, and each one came off with a young
negro ant in his mouth, and on going back
to their hill, from which Mr. Huber saw
them start, he had an opportunity of seeing
them return, and was very much surprised to
find all around the nest of the legionaries a
great many full-grown negro ants. At first
he thought that perhaps they had gone there
to fight the legionaries, but he soon saw that
instead of fighting, the negro ants went out
to meet the legionaries returning, and would
caress them, and give them food, and finally
take the young negro ants and carry them
within the nest."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, why do the legionaries
always take the young ones?"</p>

<p>"Because, boys, they know, I suppose, that
the old ants would never be satisfied to remove
from their homes; and therefore they
take the young. These legionaries could work
if they would, I think, but they depend upon
the negro ants for house and home, and food
too; and nothing can be more faithful and
affectionate than these poor slaves are. To
try them, Mr. Huber took thirty of the legionaries,
and put them with some of the larvæ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
or grubs of their own young, into a glass box
with a thick coat of earth at the bottom of it,
and he put honey also in the box, that they
might not want food. At first the legionaries
paid a little attention to their young; but they
soon stopped; and they neither tried to make
a house, nor took any food, so that in two days
half of them died. Mr. Huber then put in
<i>one</i> negro ant, and this little creature set to
work alone, made a chamber of the earth in
the box, gathered the young together, fed the
old, and put every thing into complete order.</p>

<p>"At another time Mr. Huber broke one of
the ant-hills of these legionaries, to see how
they would act, and in doing it, he, of course,
altered their galleries and chambers. The legionaries
seemed to be lost, and went wandering
about, without knowing where to go; but
the negro ants appeared to understand very
well where they were: they could find such
of the galleries as were not broken, and would
take up the legionaries in their mouths and
carry them into them. If the negro sometimes
seemed for a short time to be lost, and
not to know where it was, it laid down its
master, ran round and examined until it knew,
and then would come back, and pick up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
legionary ant, and carry it off. In one case
Mr. Huber saw that the entrance to a gallery
was stopped up by a small lump of earth; the
negro ant laid his master down, took away
the piece of earth, and then carried him in."</p>

<p>"Why, these poor negro ants are sensible
as well as faithful, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, they are so; and I think it is
likely that both kinds depend in some way
upon each other, but we have not yet found
all about it. I expect that in some things the
legionary does for the negro ant what it could
not do for itself. God has made them necessary
to each other, and this is the reason they
live together so kindly.</p>

<p>"But I think it is time now to leave the
ants, and go back to our business of seeking
for something like man's inventions and tools
among the lower animals. Perhaps hereafter
I may tell you more about ants; but at present
I must bid you good morning."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Uncle Philip."</p>

and he tells them of an Animal that makes
itself into a Ship; and of an Insect that
builds a Boat, and floats about in a Canoe;
and of another that pumps Water, and

a Raft, and floats upon it.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, boys, I have a most delightful plan
for us to-day."</p>

<p>"What is it, what is it, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Why, I have a little voyage to make, and
my boat is on the river just above the mill. I
have the men there to row it, and every thing
is ready."</p>

<p>"Oh! dear Uncle Philip, this is charming!
we shall be so happy! But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, boys?"</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip, we have not asked
leave at home. Now our parents are very
happy to have us visit you, and say that they
are very much obliged to you for telling us so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
many things; but they have told us, too, never
to get into a boat without asking their permission
first. Uncle Philip, we are sure they
will let us go, if they know that you are going;
only let us run home and ask them."</p>

<p>"My dear boys, I am very much pleased
with your conduct; and, what is far better,
my children, God is pleased; for he has
commanded you to honour your father and
mother: but you need not go home to ask
permission, for you may depend upon it I
would not take one of you upon the water
without the consent of your parents: so I
went yesterday, while you were all at school,
and have got permission from your friends
for every one of you to go&mdash;only I asked
them to tell you nothing about it."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, Uncle Philip, you are so very,
very good: thank you, thank you, a thousand
times over."</p>

<p>"Once is enough, boys. There is but one
Being who deserves a thousand thanks, and
he, in truth, deserves a great many more
than a thousand; but I fear that from a great
many he is just the Being who gets the fewest,&mdash;it
is our Heavenly Father: but come
on, boys, let us be going to the boat. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
shall soon reach her. Ah, yonder she is; I
see her through the trees."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a beauty she is, Uncle Philip,
with her green sides and white belt near
the top. We shall have a charming voyage."</p>

<p>"Come, then; get in, my little sailors, and
seat yourselves yonder in the stern. Now we
are all ready; shove off, men, and use your
oars. I will take care of the helm."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Philip, how smoothly we go
along! this is charming. Is this the way a
ship goes, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"A ship floats, boys, just as the boat does;
but she is not rowed with oars; she has sails,
and the wind blowing upon them sends her
along."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, there are no ships among
animals, are there?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; but there is a very curious little
animal which lives in the water, and manages
to rig out something like a ship, and to
sail."</p>

<p>"What is it, Uncle Philip? pray let us hear
of it."</p>

<p>"It is called the nautilus, and I saw a great
many of them in the Mediterranean sea. The
shell is nearly round, and six or eight inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
across, not much thicker than paper, and of
a whitish colour: it has, too, a keel or ridge
upon each side. When it wishes to sail, it
stretches upwards two of its legs: these have
a very thin skin at the end, which the nautilus
spreads out for sails, and the other legs
hang over on each side of the shell for oars
or rudders. When the sea is calm, a great
many of them may be seen playing about;
but as soon as a storm arises, or they are disturbed,
they take in their sails and sink to
the bottom. But, boys, the most curious boat
that I know, made by one of the dumb creatures,
is the work of the little insect that
played the doctor the other day, and stuck
his lancet into us. Do you remember what
insect that was?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, very well, Uncle Philip, it was the
gnat."</p>

<p>"True, boys, it was the gnat, which is an
insect that spends the first part of its life in
the water, and the latter part in the air.
The grub of the gnat lives in water, and I
will give you the whole history of this curious
insect. We will first speak of the eggs,
for out of these it is that the boat is made.
In order to see this boat made, you must go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
early in the morning, between five and six
o'clock, to a bucket, or pond of stagnant
water, where gnats are to be found: if you
go later you will not see it. The gnat's eggs
are shaped something like a pocket powder-flask,
and it is by putting a great many of
these together that she makes the boat. To
do this, the mother gnat stands by her fore-legs
upon the side of the bucket, or on a
leaf or stick in the pond, and her body is on
a level with the water, and rests upon it, except
the last ring of her tail, which she raises
a little. She then crosses her two hind-legs
in the shape of the letter X, and begins to
put her eggs in that part of the X nearest
to her body. So she brings her legs, crossed
in this way, near to her body, and puts an
egg in the angle, covered with a kind of glue,
which will make the eggs stick together. On
each side of the first egg she puts another in
this shape &#8258;, and here is a drawing of the
insect at this part of her work.</p>

  <div class="caption">A Gnat making her Boat of Eggs.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"She then goes on adding eggs, which are
all put in the water with their ends downwards,
until she has got her boat half-finished;
she then uncrosses her legs, and just keeps
one on each side of the boat as she goes on,
until she has completed it."</p>

<p>"And how many eggs, Uncle Philip, will
she put together in this way?"</p>

<p>"From two hundred and fifty to three hundred
and fifty, and when all are laid they
make quite a good boat, sharp, and raised at
both ends, and floating on the water. Then
the mother gnat leaves it. Here is a picture
of one of these boats.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_160.jpg" id="i_160.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_160.jpg"
  alt="gnat egg boat" />
</div>

<p>"Now I will tell you of what becomes of
the young ones in these eggs. They come
out of the lower part of the egg, and commonly
swim, with their heads downward,
near to the top of the water."</p>

<p>"With their heads downward, Uncle Philip!
what is that for?"</p>

<p>"Why, they have a tube at the end of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
bodies, near the tail, through which they
breathe; and that part must, you know, be at
the top to get air. Besides this, its tail and
its breathing tube both end in a sort of funnel,
made up of hairs placed somewhat in the
form of a star, and covered with oil, so as to
keep off water, and these buoy or float it up.
When it wishes to sink, it just folds up its
funnels, and shuts up in them a little bubble
of air, which it breathes under the water;
and when it wishes to rise, it opens its funnels,
and they float it to the top again. Here is a
drawing which will show it to you.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are hatched in a few days, and then
the boat of empty eggs floats about until it is
destroyed by the weather. And to show you
how good a boat it is, I will tell you what a
gentleman did to prove it. Mr. Kirby, who is
very fond of natural history, and has written
a great deal about insects, says that he put
half a dozen of these gnat-boats in a tumbler
half full of water, and then poured upon
them a stream from the mouth of a quart
bottle, held up a foot above them, and he could
not sink them. More than that, the water
would not stay in them. If you push one to
the bottom with your finger, it will come
up to the top directly, and you cannot see any
water in it."</p>

<p>"Why, this is a noble boat, Uncle Philip,
that will never sink."</p>

<p>"True, boys; but listen, and you will find
that before it can use its wings the gnat has
to sail in another boat still, much more dangerous
than this is. After it is hatched, it has
to pass through several shapes before it gets
to be such an insect as you see. Here is a
picture which will show you its different
shapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_163.jpg" id="i_163.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_163.jpg"
  alt="Gnat shapes" />
</div>

<p>"The first is the same which you saw in
the last picture, only in this drawing the head
is uppermost. But its last change, when it
becomes an insect with wings, is the most
curious part of the whole. When it is about
to get its wings, and become a perfect gnat, it
raises its shoulders just above the top of the
water, and its skin cracks, so that the head of
the gnat immediately comes through. The
shoulders come next, and make the crack
larger; but it has yet all its body to get out,
and its legs and wings are as yet all shut up
in its case. Now is the time of danger for
the gnat. It raises itself nearly straight out
of the crack, and by wriggling works its body
along: and if a particle of water should get
upon the case, or touch its wings, it would be
overset, and must perish. Thousands and
thousands die in this way. It is so very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
light, too, that the wind will drive it about, and
whirl it round and round upon the top of the
water; and when it is almost out, the insect
is tossed about in a canoe or boat of the very
weakest sort, while its body is a mast, which
appears much too large for so small a boat.
At last it gets far enough out of the case to
stretch its fore-legs, and put them down
upon the water (which will bear a gnat's
weight), and then it is safe; it spreads its
wings, and soon leaves the little boat which
was so dangerous. Here is a picture of the
gnat getting out of its case."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_164.jpg" id="i_164.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_164.jpg"
  alt="Gnat getting out of its case" />
</div>

<p>"Well, Uncle Philip, all this is very strange;
we never knew before that the gnat was a
sailor."</p>

<p>"I suppose that you did not, boys. But as
we are talking of boats, pray can you think of
any way of making a boat move through water
without oars, or paddles, or sails, or something
to pull it along?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"No indeed.&mdash;Oh yes, Uncle Philip, by
steam."</p>

<p>"Ah, I mentioned paddles, boys, and a
steamboat is forced along by them."</p>

<p>"No; Uncle Philip, we do not know."</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you then of another way
in which I have no doubt a boat might be
made to move. If there were any contrivance
by which a large quantity of water could be
kept in the boat, and if this water were forced
out of tubes or holes at one end very violently,
it would push against the water in which the
boat was floating, and force her along. Some
years ago a plan was thought of to make a
steam engine throw the water out of the stern
of the boat, and thus to force her along; and
before that, Dr. Franklin tried some schemes
for the same purpose, but they never succeeded.
Now there is an insect which adopts
precisely this plan, and perhaps some of those
who thought of it got the notion from the
insect."</p>

<p>"What insect is it, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"It is the grub of the dragon-fly. If you
catch one of these grubs and put it into a
saucer of water with some of the dead leaves
or sticks it had for a covering, you will see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
these leaves or sticks floating towards the tail
of the grub, and afterward driven off again.
This is because the insect is pumping in
water, and then throwing it out. If you take
one of them out of the water, and hold it with
its head down, and let a drop of water fall
upon its tail, it instantly sucks it in, and you
can see it grow larger; and when it throws it
out again it becomes smaller."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, how can you see it
suck the water in?"</p>

<p>"Very easily, boys. When it is in the
water, if you will colour some other water
with indigo, or ink, or any thing else, and
then hold a glass tube just over the tail of
the insect, and very carefully put some of the
coloured water into the tube, you will soon see
the grub spirt out a stream of it to the distance
of several inches: or if you will put the
insect in a saucer of coloured water, and then
suddenly move it, and put it into one of clean
water, you will see it spirt out the coloured
stream plainer still."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip, it must have a pump
inside of it."</p>

<p>"It has, boys, something very like one.
This stream of water is forced out to help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the insect along; for though it has six feet, it
uses them very little except for catching food.
It drives the water out so strongly against
the still water behind it, that it sends it forward,
with a dart, very rapidly. Here are
two pictures; one shows the pump open, and
the other shows it shut."</p>

  <img src="images/i_167.jpg"
  alt="Dragon-fly grub" />
</div>

<p>"Uncle Philip, is there any thing else curious
about this insect?"</p>

<p>"There is, boys, something well worth
attention; did you ever see a mask?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean, Uncle Philip, a face made
of pasteboard, very frightful commonly, which
you can wear over your own face?"</p>

<p>"That is a mask, boys; but so is any thing
which is made to wear over the face, and hide
it. Now this little insect has a mask, not
made like a man's face, but which completely
hides its mouth, and it is exceedingly curious."</p>

<p>"How is it made, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Why, boys, I am not sure that I can tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
you, so that you will understand me; but I
will try. Suppose your under-lip was horn,
instead of being flesh; and suppose it hung
straight down until it reached the bottom of
your chin, so as to cover the whole of it, and
that at the bottom there was a large three-sided
plate which was hollowed out, and fastened
by a joint or hinge to the bottom of your
long lip, so that it could turn up on the hinge
and cover your face as high up as your nose,
and hide your long lip and your mouth and
part of your cheeks: suppose, too, that at the
upper end of this long face-cover there were
two other pieces, so broad that they would
cover all your nose and your temples, and
could open sidewise like jaws, and show your
nose and mouth, so that when they were
opened they would appear like the blinders to a
horse's bridle; and then suppose that these
jaws, upon their inner edges, were cut into a
great many sharp teeth, which fitted into each
other, and you will have some notion of this
curious mask. Do you think you understand
me?"</p>

<p>"Why, pretty well, Uncle Philip, we think."</p>

<p>"Well, boys, here are some pictures, and
with their help I hope what I have been saying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
will be plain enough. In one picture the
mask is shut; and in the other, one of the jaws,
like a blinder to a bridle, is open. While the
insect is at rest, it keeps the mask over its
face; when it wishes to use it, it unfolds it,
and catches its food, and holds it to its mouth.
A gentleman once saw one of them holding
and eating a large tadpole."</p>

  <div class="caption">Mask of the Dragon-fly, shut and open.</div>
</div>

<p>"Uncle Philip, this mask is any thing but
handsome."</p>

<p>"Very true; but you know we agreed when
we were talking about the bats to look at animals
even if they were not handsome. And
there is your poor little ugly insect that you
thought it right to kill, the spider; did you
know that the spider was a sailor, too?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Uncle Philip! Pray tell us
of it, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but wait a little, until we bring the
boat's head right, for we are near the landing-place.
So&mdash;now, boys, I am ready. There
is a very large spider, about which not much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
is yet known, which actually builds a <i>raft</i>,
for the purpose of getting its food more easily.
You may see it sailing about upon the water,
on a ball of weeds about three inches across,
which is held together probably by small silk
cords spun from itself; and the moment it
sees an insect drowning, it leaves the raft, gets
the insect, and then returns to eat it at leisure.
If you frighten it, or it thinks danger is near,
in an instant it is under the raft out of sight."</p>

<p>"Ah, this is a cunning spider, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Not half so cunning, boys, as the one we
talked of which built a door to its house.
But here we are at land. Jump ashore, my
lads, and give my respects to your fathers and
mothers, when you get home."</p>

<p>"We will. Good day, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Good day, boys. I shall be glad to see
you next Saturday."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> do you do, Uncle Philip, this morning?"</p>

<p>"Very well, boys, I thank you. You are all
well, I suppose, or I should not see you here."</p>

<p>"Yes, we are all well, thank you, Uncle
Philip. But one of us would be very glad to
have your help."</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Charles Walker has run a splinter into his
hand, and he wishes you to get it out for him."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, I will do that, if I can. Let
me see: but stay&mdash;I must first put on my
spectacles. Ah, now I see it; I can get it out,
but I must take my tweezers to it. There, it
is out."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, those tweezers are very
useful. If you had not had them, you could
not have taken hold of the splinter with your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
fingers; and what would you have done
then?"</p>

<p>"Tried to cut it out with the point of my
penknife; but the tweezers are better for such
work; and that reminds me, boys, to tell you
that there are insects with tweezers."</p>

<p>"Why, what tool is it that you cannot find
among them, Uncle Philip? It really seems
as if you found almost every kind among the
lower animals."</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no, boys. There are a great
many which I cannot find; but there are several,
too, which, as you know, we have discovered."</p>

<p>"And, Uncle Philip, we suppose that men
learned to make their tools and work at many
of their trades from these dumb creatures."</p>

<p>"Stay, boys&mdash;I never said that, because I
think that it is not true. We know that in
some things men did not learn from the insects,
though they might have done so.
There is paper, for instance. How could men
learn to make it from the wasps, when it was
a thins: in common use a long time before Mr.
Reaumur, of whom I told you, found out how
the wasp made it? So, too, with a great many
tools; men invented them, and afterward,
perhaps, it was found out that insects had instruments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
like them: and at other times the
insects did show men how to make some
things. I will tell you of one which I think
of just now. The city of London, in England,
is on the river Thames. Some time
since a plan was adopted to make what is
called a tunnel under the river. This tunnel
is a road dug out of the earth, under the bottom
of the river, across it; and of course to
keep the water from pressing in the earth as
fast as it was hollowed out, it was propped up
by walls built on each side, with a very strong
arch at the top. The work has now stopped;
but about half of it was made. In building
this arched road under the water, the workmen
used what they called a shield, to keep
the water from coming through upon them:
and the gentleman who invented it, says that
he first thought of it, from examining a little
animal named Taret, which will bore holes in
large pieces of timber under the water. This
little animal has upon its head a kind of
shield, by which it keeps off the force of the
water, and works without being disturbed.
So here was a case in which the insect taught
the man."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, that gentleman was a sensible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
man, in the first place to watch the Taret
and examine its head, and in the next place
not to be too proud to learn from it. I expect
he was a naturalist; was he, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, boys; but I should think
his discovery of the shield would make him
an attentive observer, if he was not so before."</p>

<p>"Now, Uncle Philip, will you tell us of the
tweezers?"</p>

<p>"Very willingly, boys. This instrument
or tool belongs to the moths which you see
flying about at times. The tails are covered
with a down, which grows in the form of a
thick brush or tuft, and has a shining silky
gloss, different in colour from the short hair
upon the rest of the body. The moth pulls
off this hair to cover its eggs, and the tweezers
are used for that purpose. Here is a picture
of the moths."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_174.jpg" id="i_174.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_174.jpg"
  alt="Females of the brown and gold-tailed Moths" />
  <div class="caption">Females of the brown and gold-tailed Moths, showing the bunch
    of down on the tails.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, you said that the moth pulled
this hair off to cover its eggs; are they easily
frozen?"</p>

<p>"Not very easily, boys; but you are mistaken
in thinking that the moth covers these
eggs to keep off the cold; for as she lays
them in July and August, and covers them at
that time, it cannot be to keep off the cold."</p>

<p>"What is it for, then, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"To keep off the summer heat, boys."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip! who ever heard of
covering a thing up in hair or wool to keep
off heat?"</p>

<p>"I have heard of it, and seen it too, boys.
It may seem strange, but it is true, that down
and wool, and such things, are nearly as good
to protect an animal from very great outward
heat as they are to keep off very severe cold.
When I was at Naples, in Italy, it was summer;&mdash;the
climate is a very warm one.&mdash;The
country people were in the habit of bringing
snow into the city from Mount Vesuvius,
and every morning I could see them coming
in with their snow, which they sell to the
rich to use for cooling things: and they kept
it from melting with straw and wool. And
in our own country, especially at the south, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
is very common when a large lump of ice is
brought to the house to be used through the
day in midsummer, to wrap it up in a thick
blanket until it is wanted.</p>

<p>"But I have not yet told you of the tweezers.
The moth has no jaws, like bees and
wasps, so that it cannot pull off these hairs
as the bee would; but, as I told you, it performs
the work with its tweezers, which are
placed in its tail, and are like the points of a
pair of sugar-tongs. The insects, too, will
use them very rapidly, and pull off a little of
the down, spread the egg upon it, and then
cover it with more down, and smooth it very
neatly. Here are pictures of these tweezers."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_176.jpg" id="i_176.jpg"></a>

  alt="Tweezers of the brown and gold-tailed Moths" />
  <div class="caption">Tweezers of the brown and gold-tailed Moths, magnified.</div>
</div>

<p>"This is a curious instrument for the insect
to have, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"True, boys, but a very useful one. I will
tell you, however, of another strange thing
concerning moths with their tweezers; I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
mean the way in which they will sometimes
place their eggs. The kind of moth that does
this work is not exactly known, but naturalists
think that the eggs are moth's eggs, because
they are covered with the down, exactly
like those which are known to be moth's eggs.
These eggs are twisted round a branch, like
the thread of a screw, or like the curled end
of a corkscrew put over a small stick. Here
is a picture of some of these eggs."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_177.jpg" id="i_177.jpg"></a>

  alt="Spiral group of Eggs" />
  <div class="caption">Spiral group of Eggs of an unknown Moth.</div>
</div>

<p>"Ah, this is wonderful work indeed for a
moth, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"As you seem to like this, boys, I will just
mention to you that there is another moth,
called the lackey-moth, which winds its eggs
also around a branch. They are hard, however,
and not covered with any down, and are
put on in the strongest possible way. If men
wish to make an arch of stone, you know that
the stones will be more narrow at the bottom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
than at the top, so that the bottom of the arch
may make a small circle, and the top a larger
one: thus&mdash;</p>

  alt="Key-stone of an arch" />
  <div class="caption"><strong>A</strong>, Key-stone of an arch;
  <strong>B</strong>, Arch completed.</div>
</div>

<p>Now the moth goes on this principle. Its eggs
are shaped like the bowl of a wine-glass, and
the smaller end is put next to the branch.
They are all glued together, too, with a kind
of gum, which will not dissolve or melt in
water; so that the rain cannot injure them.
Here is a picture of these eggs.</p>

<p>"There is another insect, boys, which has
something like tweezers; though I think they
resemble pincers most."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"The boys call it father long-legs, and I
dare say you have often seen it. It is the
crane-fly, and its pincers are used for putting
its egg in the hole it has made for it."</p>

<p>"Where does it put its eggs, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_179.jpg" id="i_179.jpg"></a>

  alt="Ovipositor and Eggs of the Crane-fly" />
  <div class="caption">Ovipositor and Eggs of the Crane-fly.</div>
</div>

<p>"In the earth, boys; and to enable the insect
to do this, the female has the pincers I
spoke of: they are made of something like
horn, and are sharp at the point. With these
she first bores a hole in the ground, and then
puts the egg in. The egg is like a grain of
gunpowder, and she puts herself in a very
curious posture to bore the hole. Here,
boys, you may see a picture of the pincers as
they appear through a microscope, for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
are not near as large as the picture. And
here is a drawing of one boring."</p>

  <div class="caption">Crane-fly ovipositing, and the larva beneath, in the

</div>

<p>"What good pincers those are, Uncle
Philip: but will you tell us one thing which
we wish to know? Talking about the crane-fly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
has put me in mind of it: the other day
we were sitting together in school, and the
wall over our heads was covered with common
flies; and when we came out, we were
talking about the way in which the fly stuck
to the wall without falling down; and as we
could not tell what kept him up, we agreed
to ask you about it."</p>

<p>"I will tell you, boys, very willingly. I
do not wonder that you were unable to tell how
the fly stuck to the wall; for you never tried to
find out, and therefore could only guess at it."</p>

<p>"And that is not a good way to find out
any thing, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"No, boys; though some persons much older
than you are, did nothing but guess about this
very thing, and guessed very far from the truth
too. Some thought that the fly had a sponge
in its foot, and squeezed a sort of glue out of
it which made it stick fast; others said that
the glass or wall was so rough that the fly's
feet would catch hold of the little points upon
it; but both were wrong."</p>

<p>"How does it hold on, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever see what the boys call a
sucker, made of a piece of soft sole leather?
That will show you how the fly's foot sticks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
fast. This leather is cut round, and has a
string through the centre; the boys wet it,
and then put it upon a board or something
smooth, and stamp on it, and try to raise it
up from the board by the string; and it requires
some strength to pull it up: sometimes
they put it on a small smooth stone, and then
lift up the stone by it. The reason why the
leather sticks so fast is because the air is
pressing on it upon the outside, and there is
very little or no air between it and the board,
to press the other way."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip, is the air heavy?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, boys, when there is so much of it
as there is above the earth, it presses down
very heavily. Now the fly's foot is like the
sucker; when he puts it down he has a contrivance
to drive out the air from under it, so
that there will be little or none between it and
the wall; and then the outer air presses upon
it, and holds it fast."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, how does he get it up
again?"</p>

<p>"Why, boys, by another contrivance, he
can let air in under his foot again, and then
he can easily move it; for we do not feel the
weight of air when it presses upon both sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
of us. The reason why you stand up straight
is because the air is pressing all around you;
if it were on one side of you only, it would
press you down on the other side. Here is a
picture of the fly's foot, as it appears through
the microscope. You will see it has three
suckers with the edges all like saws; these are
to make it stick the closer. This picture, boys,
is sixty-four hundred times as large as the fly's
foot is."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, there is one thing yet
hard to understand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, the fly walks on the wall over our
heads; now the air cannot press down upon
his feet there."</p>

<p>"Very true, boys: it cannot press <i>down</i>, but
it can and does press <i>up</i> against his feet; for
the air presses up and down and sidewise all
alike."</p>

<p>"Ah, now it is plain enough, and we are
much obliged to you, Uncle Philip, for telling
us what we wished to know."</p>

<p>"You are quite welcome, my dear boys, to
all that I can teach you: if it makes you to
be wiser and better men when you grow up, I
shall be very thankful to God that I have
been able to do you any good."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Boys</span>, do you remember my telling you of
a remarkable bird, called the tailor-bird, which
sews very neatly?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Uncle Philip; it is not easy to
forget such an excellent little workman; but
why do you ask&mdash;have you any thing more
to tell us about that bird?"</p>

<p>"No, boys, not any thing of that bird; but
I was thinking last night of the work done
by several other kinds of birds, some of them
quite as good workmen as our little tailor;
and I thought that, perhaps, you might like to
hear of them."</p>

<p>"We would, Uncle Philip, be very happy
to hear of them, if you will have the kindness
to tell us about them. But what kind of work
is it they do?"</p>

<p>"Various kinds, boys. There are some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
which make what is called <i>felt</i>, just as the
hat-maker does; and some are weavers, others
basket-makers; some build platforms to live
on; and I assure you some birds' nests are as
curious as any of the things of which I have
yet told you."</p>

<p>"Pray let us hear of them, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Very well, you shall. I will begin with
birds that make felt like the hatter. Do you
know how a hat is made?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, Uncle Philip; but we know
what it is made of."</p>

<p>"What is it, boys?"</p>

<p>"Of sheep's wool, and the hair of other
animals: is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, commonly of these things; and to
understand what I am going to tell you, I
think it will be necessary first to say something
about the hatter's trade. The business
of the man who makes a hat is to mix up wool
or hair in such a way that it will stick together
and make felt; or something like a
piece of thick, strong cloth. To do this, he
does not weave the hairs together, for they are
of different kinds, and of different lengths,
and it would be endless work to weave every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
one in; besides the cloth or felt would not be
thick enough when it was done."</p>

<p>"How do they stick together then, Uncle
Philip?"</p>

<p>"Why, boys, their sticking together is
owing to something in the hairs themselves.
I will show you. Pull a hair out of your
head; now hold it just between the ends of
your two fore-fingers, and rub the fingers
gently against each other."</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip! see, the hair is moving
towards my body."</p>

<p>"Very true; and if you will turn it with
the other end towards you, and rub your
fingers as before, you will see it move from
your body."</p>

<p>"This is very strange, Uncle Philip: the
hair is smooth; how can my fingers make it
move so?"</p>

<p>"No, that is a mistake, boys, the hair is
not smooth. If some kinds of coarse hair are
seen through the microscope, each one will
seem to be, not one hair, but ten or twelve
smaller ones, which are joined at the root, and
form a hollow tube, like a straw; and sometimes
it will have joints just like some kinds
of grass or straw. In some sorts of finer hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
you cannot see this even with the microscope;
but you can feel it, as you did just now when
you moved your fingers. These joints overlap
one another, just as if you should take
several pieces of straw and stick them into
each other. I will show you some pictures
of hairs as seen through the microscope, and
then these joints will be plain enough."</p>

  <div class="caption">Hairs of (<i>a</i>) the Bat, (<i>b</i>) the Mole,
     and (<i>c</i>) the Mouse.</div>
</div>

<p>"These are strange-looking hairs, Uncle
Philip."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are curious; but now you may
see why, when hairs are worked together, they
may be made to stick to each other. These
rough parts catch into each other, and hook
themselves; and the more you press them or
move them, the more closely you work them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
into one solid mass, which you cannot easily
pull to pieces. Besides, you must remember
that the hairs will work only one way, as you
found out just now when your finger ends
caught upon the little joints and moved them
along. Now, suppose that a very large heap
of hairs, or wool, or fur, after it is made ready,
should be put upon a table, and covered with
a linen cloth, and pressed down in different
directions. Each hair would begin to move
in the direction of its root, just as it did between
your fingers, and so all would be joined
together at last into one solid piece."</p>

<p>"We understand you, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Then you understand, boys, the way in
which a hat is made. These hairs are all
worked together by the hands of the hat-maker,
and to make them work more easily
(for curled hair, such as wool, does not move
easily) the hatter uses hot water, and dips his
hat in it while he is working it. After it is
done, it is died, and then put upon a wooden
block to give it shape, and is ironed smooth."</p>

<p>"And this is the way, then, Uncle Philip,
to make hats: it is curious, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys; but plain enough when you
come to examine into it. And the best stuff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
for the hatters is such hair as has most joints
ready to catch into each other: the rabbit's
hair is very good, and for that reason."</p>

<p>"And is it possible, Uncle Philip, that any
bird can do such work as this?"</p>

<p>"Not only possible, boys, but true. There
are several birds very expert at making felt,
and their nest appears like a piece of hatter's
felt, or double-milled woollen cloth. I do not
mean to say that it is as close and solid as the
hat or cloth; it would feel in your fingers
looser than either, still it is quite close; and
when you examine it, you will find it put
together in the same way; it is all carded into
one mass, and not woven together thread by
thread, or hair by hair."</p>

<p>"And are there many birds able to do such
work, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"I told you, boys, that there were several.
The chief article which they use is wool, but
with this many other things will be found
mixed&mdash;sometimes, upon the outside, fine
moss&mdash;sometimes pieces of a spider's web rolled
up into a little bundle&mdash;sometimes, when cotton
can be had, they will use small bunches of
cotton-wool; but sheep's wool they must have,
and by means of that, they contrive to make,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
with the other things I have mentioned, a felt
wonderfully smooth."</p>

<p>"Is it smooth on the outside, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes quite so; but always as smooth
on the inside, when it is first made, as if it had
been felted together by the hat-maker. There
is another thing curious enough in some of
these nests. The hatter, you know, binds the
rim of his hat to make it stronger; and some
of these felt-making birds will make their nests
stronger by a binding all around them of dry
grass stems, and sometimes of slender roots,
and they take care to cover these grass stems,
or roots, with their felt-work of moss and
wool. But there is something else not less
strange, I think, than the binding. It is this:
they will build their nests in the fork of a
shrub or tree; and to keep them from falling,
they will work bands of this felt round all the
branches which touch the nest, both below
and at the sides. And those parts of the nest
which touch the large branches are always
thinner than the other parts, which have no
support; in those parts the nest is nothing
but a thin wall of felt, fixed around to fit the
shape of the branch, and that is enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
make that part of the nest warm and soft.
Here is a picture of one of these felt-nests,
fastened in the way of which I have been telling
you."</p>

  alt="Chaffinch's Nest" />
  <div class="caption">Chaffinch's Nest on an Elder-tree.</div>
</div>

<p>"This, boys, is the nest of the chaffinch.
The goldfinch makes a nest of the same kind,
only rather neater and smoother than that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the chaffinch; for it takes pains to show
nothing but the wool, and covers up all the
other materials which it uses."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, do these birds all use the
same things to make their nests?"</p>

<p>"All use wool, boys; but the truth is, that
birds will commonly take for their nests that
article which they can get most easily, if it will
suit. A gentleman, named Bolton, tried this
with some goldfinches. He saw a pair of
these birds beginning to build in his garden;
they had laid the foundation of their nest with
moss, and grass, and such things, as they
commonly use: he scattered some wool about
in different parts of the garden; the birds took
the wool: afterward he scattered cotton;
they took the cotton: on the next day he gave
them some very fine down; they took that,
and finished the nest with it, and a very handsome
nest it was."</p>

<p>"How long were they in making it, Uncle
Philip?"</p>

<p>"Three days. The canary-bird, boys,
which you sometimes see in cages, when free,
builds a nest of the same kind. But the most
curious felt-makers among the birds, are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Africa. There is the Cape-tit, a bird in the
southern part of Africa, which builds a very
strange nest: it is shaped like a bottle of
India-rubber, as thick as a coarse worsted
stocking, and made of cotton, and down, and
other things felted together. On one side of
the nest there is something like a pocket, and
here is a picture of it."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_194.jpg" id="i_194.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_194.jpg"
  alt="Nest of the Cape-tit" />
  <div class="caption">Nest of the Cape-tit, from Sonnerat.</div>
</div>

<p>"Uncle Philip, what is that pocket for?"</p>

<p>"Why, boys, some have supposed that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
was for the male bird to sit on and keep watch,
while the female was inside of the nest sitting
on the eggs; but I think this is a mistake.
And some have said, that when the female
leaves the nest, and the male wishes to go too,
he sits in this pocket, and beats against the
side of the nest with his wing until he has
made the edges of the top meet, and thus shuts
up the mouth of the nest, and keeps off insects
and other animals that would eat the young
ones; but I do not believe this story."</p>

<p>"Then what do you think the pocket is for.
Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"I think, boys, that it is nothing but a
perch, or place for the bird to sit on before
going into the nest. If the bird had no such
place for stopping, it might be troubled to
get into its nest. The mouth is small, and
the bird could not enter it with its wings
spread; and if it should alight on the edge of
the nest constantly, it would injure it, for it is
but slightly made. And I will tell you another
reason why I think this is the use of the
pocket. There is another bird in South
Africa, called the pinc-pinc, which is the same
species of bird as the Cape-tit; and this bird
we know uses its little nest built upon the side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of the other merely as a resting-place before
going into the nest."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, does the pinc-pinc build its
nest like a bottle, as the Cape-tit does?"</p>

<p>"No, boys, not so smooth, but felted in the
same way. The nest is made mostly of the
down of plants, and is either snowy white or
brownish, according to the colour of the down.
On the outside it is a clumsy-looking thing,
but fastened, like the nest of the chaffinch,
very firmly to the branches near it, so that
you cannot take it away without breaking it to
pieces. But rough as the outside is, you would
be astonished, if you were to look at the inside,
and see how a bird, and a small one too, with
nothing but its wings, and tail, and feet, and
bill for tools, could ever have worked the
down of plants together, so as to make of it a
piece of fine cloth. It has a narrow neck, something
like a chimney, at the top of it. This is the
entrance; and at the lower end of it there is
a lump, which appears something like a small
nest stuck on to the larger one; sometimes
there will be three or four of these small-looking
nests, and sometimes when there is a
branch near the mouth of the nest which
makes a good resting-place, there will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
none. Here is a picture, boys, of the outside
of one of these nests.</p>

<p>These birds are easily
watched; and a French gentleman, who has
written the best account of the birds of Africa,
<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
says that he has found at least a hundred of
these nests, and watched the birds for a whole
morning together, and never saw one sitting
on the small nest as a watch-bird; but
has seen both the male and female arrive at
the nest together, perch upon the nearest
branch, hop from this upon the edge of the
little nest, and then putting their heads into the
hole, dart into the large nest. And now, boys,
what do you think about the use of these
little pockets?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Philip, we think that what you
tell us is always right, because you know a
great deal more than we do."</p>

<p>"But, boys, you do not understand me. I
may be mistaken, though I do know more
than you. I have been telling you my reasons
for thinking these little pockets are nothing
but perches. Do you think the reasons are
good ones?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Uncle Philip, we do. The
French gentleman who watched the birds so
much would have seen some of them using
the pockets for a place to keep watch in, if
they were made for that."</p>

<p>"Right, boys. What I wish to teach you
is to think for yourselves. Whenever any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
one gives you a reason for a thing, just ask
yourselves, 'Is this a good reason?'"</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, how did it happen that
the other people who saw these birds should
have said that these pockets were for the male
bird to sit in and watch?"</p>

<p>"I suppose, boys, that they really thought
so; but then they had not noticed the birds
enough to find out the truth. It requires a
great deal of time and patience to find out the
truth about animals: and this is the reason
why so many mistakes have been printed
about them. It is a pity that such mistakes
have been made; for really there is enough
that is very curious about them, without
men's making stories to appear strange. But
I think that there will be fewer mistakes
made in future."</p>

<p>"Why so, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Because, boys, men are taking more pains
to see for themselves. There are more naturalists
now than there were formerly; and I
hope there will be more still, especially in our
own large and beautiful country, where there
have not yet been many. I hope that natural
history will be studied in all our schools before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
a great while. But let us go back to our
African birds.</p>

<p>"There is another kind which Mr. Vaillant
speaks of, and I will tell you of that. He calls
it the capocier, and he had a very fine opportunity
to watch two of them. It is a bird
easily made gentle, and he had managed by
feeding two of them to make them so tame
that they would come into his tent and hop
about several times in a day, though he never
had them in a cage. When it became time
for them to build a nest, they staid away for
some time, and would come to the tent once
only in four or five days. At last they began
to come regularly, as before, and Mr. Vaillant
soon found out what they came for. They
had seen upon his table cotton and moss and
flax, which he used to stuff the skins of birds,
and which were always lying there; and the
capociers had come for these things, to build
their nest of them. They would take up
large bunches of them in their bills and fly
away. Mr. Vaillant followed and watched
them to see the nest built, and found them at
work in the corner of a garden, by the side of
a spring, in a large plant which grew under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the shade of a tree. They were building in
the fork of the branches, and had laid the
foundation, which was about four inches high
and six inches across. This part was made
of moss and flax, mixed with grass and tufts
of cotton. The next day this gentleman never
left the side of the nest: the female was at
work building, and the male brought the materials.
In the morning the male bird made
twenty-nine journeys to Mr. Vaillant's table
for flax and cotton and moss; and in the afternoon
he made seventeen. He would help
his mate to trample down and press the cotton
with his body, so as to make it into felt.
Whenever he came with a load, he would put
it either upon the edge of the nest or upon
some branch within reach of the female.</p>

<p>"After he began to help the female at her
work, he would often break off, and begin to
play; and sometimes, as if in mischief, he
would pull down a little of her work. She
would get angry, and peck him with her bill:
but he still continued to vex her, until at
last, to save her work from being pulled down,
she would stop working, and fly off from bush
to bush, to tease him. They would then
make up the quarrel, and she set about her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
work, while he would sing most delightfully
for several minutes. After his song was finished,
he would go to work again, until he
got into a new fit of mischief and frolic, and
then he would torment her as before.</p>

<p>"On the third day the birds began to build
the walls, after having repeatedly pressed the
bottom, and turned themselves round upon it
in all directions, to make the nest solid. They
first made a plain border all around; this they
trimmed, and on it they piled up tufts of cotton,
which they felted in by beating and pressing
with their breasts and wings; and if any
part stuck out, they worked it in with their
bills, so as to make all perfectly smooth and
firm. And they worked their nest round the
branches near it, just as the chaffinch does.</p>

<p>"In seven days they finished it. It was as
white as snow, and on the outside it was nine
inches high, and not smooth or regular in its
shape; but in the inside it was shaped exactly
like a hen's egg, with the small end up: the
hollow was five inches high, and between
four and five inches across; and it was so
neatly felted together that it might have been
taken for a piece of fine cloth a little worn;
and so close that you could not take away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
any part without tearing the nest in pieces.
Here is a picture of the nest, boys, and it is
wonderful work for a small bird."</p>

  <div class="caption">Nest of the Capocier, from Vaillant's figure.</div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Philip! we like the capociers
very much. When they were tired of working,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
they were ready to play; and when they
had played enough, they went back to work.
Do not you think there was good sense in
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, I do: it will not do, either to
work all the time or to play all the time. All
that we have to do is to take care that we
do not spend more time than we should at
either. But there is a sweet little bird, boys,
quite common in our own country, which
makes felt: would you like to hear of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Uncle Philip. What bird is it?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_204.jpg" id="i_204.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i_204.jpg"
  alt="Nest of the Humming-bird" />
  <div class="caption">Nest of the Humming-bird.</div>
</div>

<p>"It is the humming-bird. Here is a drawing
of its nest. It is about an inch deep, and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
inch across; and from a little distance, appears
more like a small knot upon the branch than
like a bird's nest. The outside of the nest
from which this picture is made, was covered
with a kind of bluish-gray lichen, that grows
in scales upon old trees and fences: this
seemed to be glued on by the bird in some
way or other. The inside was the felt, and
was made of the fine down from seeds that
float about in the air, mixed with the down
from mullein-weed and stalks of fine grass.
This, boys, is the smallest nest made by a
bird, I believe; and some insects make larger
houses for themselves than this bird does.</p>

<p>"But I have not time at present to talk
with you any longer, as I have letters to
write; and therefore I must bid you good
morning."</p>

<p>"Farewell, Uncle Philip."</p>

<div class="chapsum"><i>Uncle Philip tells the Boys about Birds that
are Weavers; and about the Politician-bird;
and a Story about some Philosophers;
and what may be learned from these Conversations.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, boys, were you pleased enough
with our last conversation to wish to hear
more about birds' nests?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you please, Uncle Philip. You
said something about birds that were weavers;
we should like to hear something of them."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; I will talk about the
weavers this morning. And the first thing I
have to say is that this is no uncommon trade
among birds. Take the nest of any of the
common small birds that use hair for a lining,
and you will be apt to find some part of it
woven."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Philip, you do not mean that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
birds weave as smoothly and regularly as
people do!"</p>

<p>"Not quite, boys; but still it is very fair
weaving, and done as our weaving is, by
working a hair or thread in and out between
other hairs and threads, or roots, or bits of stick
and grass. The best way to see it, is to remove
the outside work of hay or roots very
carefully, or to take away the felt-work of
wool or moss, and you may see a round piece
of hair-cloth, sometimes finer, and sometimes
coarser, according to the bird that made it,
and the things of which it is made. In the
common sparrow's nest the hair-cloth is very
thin, so that you can see through it easily;
but still every hair is woven in singly, and
always bent, so as to lie smooth in the bottom
of the nest. And there are no ends of hairs
left sticking out; they are always worked
into the moss which makes the outside of the
nest."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, how do the birds make the
hairs lie smooth in their places?"</p>

<p>"About that, boys, there is some uncertainty.
Some persons think that the birds
have a kind of glue in their mouths by which
they make them stick; and others suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
that they wet the hairs, so as to make them
bend. But there are much better weavers
than the common sparrow. The red-breast
and the yellow-hammer are both better workmen."</p>

<p>"Where do they get hairs. Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"They find bunches of them sticking in
the cracks of a fence or post where a horse or
cow has been rubbing; and some of these little
creatures, when they find such a bunch, will
pull it to pieces, and work it in, hair by hair."</p>

<p>"Are there many of these weaver-birds.
Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, a great many: our country is
quite full of them. There is the mountain
ant-catcher,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> which will weave a nest of dry
grass, and wind the blades round the branches
of a tree; and the king-bird,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which first
makes a basket frame-work of slender sticks,
and afterward weaves in wool and tow, and
lines it with hairs and dry grass. There is
another, too, the white-eyed fly-catcher, which
some have called the politician. This bird
builds its nest and hangs it up by the upper
edge of the two sides on a vine. The outside
is made of pieces of rotten wood, threads of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
dry stalks or weeds, pieces of paper, commonly
old newspapers; and all these are
woven together with caterpillar's silk, and
lined with fine dry grass and hair."</p>

<p>"Uncle Philip, why do they call it the politician?
What is a politician?"</p>

<p>"What is commonly called a politician,
boys, is a person who is always reading in
newspapers about the government of the
country, and talking a great deal about the
President and Congress, and the laws that are
made, and all such things: but the real politician
is one who studies the different kinds
of government which have been in the world,
and endeavours to find out which is good and
which is bad, and why they are good or bad.
He reads, too, a great deal of history, to learn
how other nations have done, what kind of
laws they made, and why they made them,
how they became great nations, or how they
became very poor; and he <i>thinks</i>, too, a great
deal, that he may find out what will be best
for his own nation. It requires hard study
and thought, boys, to make a good politician."</p>

<p>"Then, Uncle Philip, a man cannot learn
how to be one out of the newspapers."</p>

<p>"No, boys; not out of newspapers alone:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
but still he will read them, and very often
learn from them things very useful to him in
his business. Newspapers are valuable things,
and I think it is always best for a country to
have a great many of them spread about in it.
But they will not, of themselves, make a man
a politician; and if you should ask the persons
who print them, whether they expect
them to teach men all about governments,
they will tell you, No: but they will teach
people what is doing in all the governments
in the world. No good government, boys,
will ever be afraid to let the people have
newspapers. They are always fewest where
the government is hardest upon the people.
But let us go back to the birds. Can you tell
me now why some people call the fly-catcher
a politician?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; because he has so many bits of
old newspapers about his nest."</p>

<p>"That is the reason, boys. There is another
kind of fly-catcher, called the hooded
fly-catcher, and it weaves its nest of flax and
strings pulled from the stalks of hemp: but
the best weaver in this country is the Baltimore
starling. This bird chooses the ends of
high bending branches for his nest, and he
begins in a forked twig, by fastening strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
strings of hemp or flax around both branches
of the fork, just as far apart as he means the
width of his nest to be: he then with the same
kind of strings, mixed in with pieces of loose
tow, weaves a strong, firm kind of cloth, which
is like the hatter's felt in appearance, only that
you can see that the nest is woven, not felted.
In this way he makes a pouch, or purse, six
or seven inches deep, and lines it on the inside
with several soft things, which he weaves
into the outside netting, and finishes the
whole with horse-hair. Mr. Wilson describes
one of these nests which he had. He says
that it was round like a cylinder. Do you
know what a cylinder is?"</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"A smooth round pillar to hold up a porch
is a cylinder; my walking-cane is a cylinder;
so is the straight body of a tree. When these
are of the same size all through their whole
length, they are perfect cylinders; and any
thing in that shape is a cylinder."</p>

<p>"We understand you, Uncle Philip; a gun-barrel
is a cylinder, and there is a cylinder in
your garden."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The heavy stone roller that you let us
pull over the walks."</p>

  <div class="caption">Baltimore Starling, and Nest.</div>
</div>

<p>"Right. Well, this nest was like a cylinder,
about five inches across, and seven inches long.
At the top the bird had worked a level cover,
so as to leave a hole only two inches and a half
across; at the bottom it was round. It was
made of flax, tow, hemp, hair, and wool, and
was woven into a complete cloth; it was also
tightly sewed through and through with long
horse-hairs, some of which when drawn out
measured two feet. Here is a picture of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
nest. In the bottom it had bunches of cows'
hair, and these were also sewed down with
horse-hairs. This bird, boys, is a thief."</p>

<p>"A thief, Uncle Philip! What does it
steal?"</p>

<p>"When I say it is a thief, boys, I mean that
it takes what does not belong to it: but it is
not a thief as man is. When a man takes
something which belongs to another person, he
<i>knows</i> that it is not his; and therefore he
steals: but the poor bird does not know, and
that makes a difference. You asked me what
it steals: I will tell you. At the time for
building its nest, it will take whatever suits
for that purpose; and therefore the country
women are obliged to watch their thread that
they have put out to bleach: the farmer, too,
who has cut off young grafts from his fruit-trees
and tied them up in bundles, must be
careful, or the bird will pull at the string till
he gets it off; and sometimes, when the bunch
is not too large, he will fly off with the whole.
In autumn, when the leaves have fallen, you
may sometimes see skeins of silk and hanks
of thread hanging about the starling's nest,
but so woven up and entangled in it that they
are good for nothing. Now, boys, before this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
country was settled by people from Europe,
where do you suppose the starling got silk and
thread for his nest?"</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Philip, are you sure he got
them at all?"</p>

<p>"A very sensible question, boys. When
you are asked <i>why</i> a thing is so, it is always
well, first to be satisfied that it is so, before
you begin to look for a reason. I have read
a story about this very thing: would you
like to hear it?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Uncle Philip."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I have read that there were
once several philosophers (I told you what a
philosopher is, you know), who were in the
habit of meeting together to put questions to
each other, and to make new discoveries. At
one of these meetings, one of them asked the
others, '<i>Why</i> a fish weighed more <i>in</i> the water
than he did <i>out</i> of it?' Several of them gave
very wise reasons, as they thought; and all
the reasons were different: so they could not
agree. There was among them, however, a
very sensible old gentleman, who listened to
them all, but said nothing. When he went
home, he got a fish and weighed it, out of the
water, and wrote down its weight; he then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
took a bucket of water, and weighed that; and
when he dropped the fish in the bucket, he
found that it increased the weight of the whole,
precisely as many pounds as the fish had
weighed out of the water; so he found out
that there was no reason why a fish weighed
more in the water than he did out of it, because
it was not true: his weight was the
same either in or out of it."</p>

<p>"Ah, Uncle Philip, that is a pleasant story:
he was a sensible old gentleman."</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, he was; and it was sensible in
you to ask first whether the starling <i>did use</i>
silk and thread before Europeans came here;
and after that is answered, it is time enough to
ask where he got such things. Now the truth
is, that he <i>did not</i> use them until after Europeans
brought them here; because there
were no such things in this country: for the
Indians who lived here could not make thread.
I think; and I am sure they could not spin
silk: but I will tell you, boys, what it shows
us; and it is that I wish you to notice."</p>

<p>"What is it, Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>"It is the wisdom of this bird in taking advantage
of circumstances. No doubt he built
very good nests long before silk and thread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
were in the country; but he had sense enough
to know that they were exactly what suited
him, and he used them as soon as he could
get them."</p>

<p>"Then, Uncle Philip, you think that the
bird has reason?"</p>

<p>"No, boys, I do not: but you have reason,
and I have something to say to you about it.
It is this: as God has given you reason, and
so made you better than the poor dumb animals,
he expects more from you. That is
fair, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Philip; very fair."</p>

<p>"Then what I wish you to remember is
this: that you must use your reason in such
way as to glorify God. He gave it to you
to learn his will and his commandments, and
to live accordingly. So now you see the
things which our conversations about the
animals can teach us. In the first place, we
see the goodness of God; in the second place,
we see the power of God; in the third place,
we see the wisdom of God: and we see in
ourselves that God has done more for us than
he has done for them, and therefore we ought
to love and serve him: we ought to believe
what he says in his Word; we ought to pray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
to him for his blessed help; we ought, <i>first of
all</i>, to seek the salvation of our souls, through
our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear children, to-morrow I must
leave home for a few weeks; but when I come
back we will talk together again: and as I
am going to see my nephews, I will get a
book which they printed about insects; it is
called the History of Insects,
<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;and I will
bring it to you; and some of the largest boys
among you may read it aloud, and I will explain
to you what you cannot understand. If
you are pleased with what I have been telling
you, that book will tell you a great deal more."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Uncle Philip. We shall
like it very much."</p>

<p>"Farewell, boys."</p>

<p>"Good-by, dear Uncle Philip."</p>

<p class="center">"Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,
which is Jesus Christ."</p>

<p class="center margin-top1">AUTHOR'S ADDRESS</p>

<p>No doubt can be felt as to the fact, that there are at present
many crying evils in all ranks of society&mdash;perhaps there never
was a time when more remedies were proposed. It is, however,
a melancholy truth, that the only remedy is too generally over-looked,
or despised. Remedies, selfish in principle, and selfish
in their proposed end, are held forth and confided in by those
who profess to be Christians, and, as such, dependent on the
Great Head of the church. Man is taught how to live in time,
and to be wise for time; but it has become unusual to refer to
that fine old scriptural prayer, "So teach us to number our days
that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom." Indeed, the wisdom
desired by too many is that which is so forcibly described
by an apostle's pen, as "earthly, sensual, devilish;" not that
wisdom the attributes of which form the graces of man's new
and regenerate character, which is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, and easy to be entreated; "full of mercy and good fruits,
without partiality, and without hypocrisy."</p>

<p>It is intended, in the series of narratives now advertised, to set
forth, faithfully and simply, the one great principle on which
Christians profess to act. This principle should never be lost
sight of, in any publication addressed by a Christian author to
Christian readers. "Other foundation can no man lay, than that
is laid," laid by Infinite Wisdom himself&mdash;"which is Christ
Jesus." My illustrations will extend to every class of society;
from the highest to the lowest. When it is found necessary to
introduce the subject of political economy, I shall endeavour to
give what seem to me the right views of the subject; and I shall
take care to show, that when political economy cannot be identified
with Christian economy, it ought to occupy a subordinate
place. If it enters society as the servant of Christian principle, it
may be very useful as a servant; but, if it is to teach a man to
walk in the counsel of the ungodly, to speak of its usefulness in
a Christian community is absurd.</p>

<p>False principles, however taking they may be, for a while,
with the ignorant, or with those who are not deep thinkers, can
never stand for any length of time; and as for the ungodly, we
know <i>Who</i> has told us they are "like the chaff which the wind
driveth away." I have undertaken this work in a spirit of prayer
to God for His assistance, and His blessing. Many of my readers.
I am sure, will unite their prayers to mine, that it may be continued
in the same spirit. Some few may object to this address
from a minister of Christ to a Christian community, and say that
it is according to the puritanical cant of the day. I answer, that
such cant (if mere cant) is quite as offensive to me as to themselves;
almost as offensive as the cant of ungodliness; but I
cannot forget those words of solemn warning, from One who,
alas, is still the despised and rejected of many men: "Whosoever
shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous
and sinful generation, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed,
when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy
angels."</p>
